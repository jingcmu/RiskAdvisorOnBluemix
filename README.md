RiskAdvisorOnBluemix
====================

This is a practicum project, sponsored by IBM Watson Research Center. Leveraging the latest service oriented computing and cloud computing techniques, we have designed and developed a Web 2.0 application, providing on-line web that can analyze, visualize and predict companyâ€™s financial situation. 

There are two independent project in this repository. One is WebCrawler and the other one is RiskExtractor. These two projects are merged into the RiskAdvisor project which has been deployed to IBM bluemix. However, it is convenient to experiment on these seperated projects to improve the algorithm.
