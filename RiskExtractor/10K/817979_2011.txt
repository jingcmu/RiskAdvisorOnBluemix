item 1a.    risk factors factors that may affect future results         in this report, we have made various statements regarding current expectations or forecasts of future events. these statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of that term in section 27a of the securities act of 1933 (the "securities act") and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"). forward-looking statements are also made from time-to-time in press releases and in oral statements made by our officers. forward-looking statements are identified by the words "estimate," "project," "anticipate," "will continue," "will likely result," "expect," "intend," "believe," "plan," "predict" and similar expressions. 17 table of contents         such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect. therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon these estimates and statements. these statements or estimates may not be realized and actual results may differ from those contemplated in these "forward-looking statements." we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. you are advised to consult further disclosures we may make on related subjects in our filings with the sec. our expectations, beliefs, or projections may not be achieved or accomplished. in addition to other factors discussed in the report, some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the following risk factors. risks related to our business and industry we rely on, and make significant operational decisions based in part upon, industry data and forecasts that may prove to be inaccurate.         we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment and our ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by economic or other conditions that are beyond our control and which are difficult to predict. the 2011 production forecasts by act publications for the significant commercial vehicle markets that we serve, as of march 10, 2011, are as follows: north american class 8     244,000   north american classes 5-7     146,660   u.s. trailers     209,400   the failure to realize cost savings under our cost restructuring plan could adversely affect our business.         during 2008, 2009, and 2010, we implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to, among other things, significant downturns in our industry. these initiatives have included aligning our workforce in response to slowdowns in the industry and consolidating certain of our facilities. we have recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives. we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will sufficiently help in returning us to profitability. because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. even if these activities generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition. we are dependent on sales to a small number of our major customers and on our status as standard supplier on certain truck platforms of each of our major customers.         sales, including aftermarket sales, to navistar, paccar, dtna, and volvo/mack constituted approximately 21.1%, 13.8%, 11.9%, and 7.0%, respectively, of our 2010 combined net sales. no other customer accounted for more than 5% of our net sales for this period. the loss of any significant portion of sales to any of our major customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.         we are a standard supplier of various components at a majority of our major customers, which results in recurring revenue as our standard components are installed on most trucks ordered from that platform, unless the end user specifically requests a different product, generally at an additional charge. the selection of one of our products as a standard component may also create a steady demand for that product in the aftermarket. we may not maintain our current standard supplier positions in the future, and may not become the standard supplier for additional truck platforms. the loss of a 18 table of contents significant standard supplier position or a significant number of standard supplier positions with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.         we are continuing to engage in efforts intended to improve and expand our relations with each of the customers named above. we have supported our position with these customers through direct and active contact with end users, trucking fleets, and dealers, and have located certain of our marketing personnel in offices near these customers and most of our other major customers. we may not be able to successfully maintain or improve our customer relationships so that these customers will continue to do business with us as they have in the past or be able to supply these customers or any of our other customers at current levels. the loss of a significant portion of our sales to any of these named customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the delay or cancellation of material orders from, or problems at, any of our other major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. see "item 1a혰risk factors혰current economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may have a material adverse effect on our industry, business and results of operations." increased cost or reduced supply of raw materials and purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.         our business is subject to the risk of price increases and fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of raw materials and purchased components that are beyond our control. our operations require substantial amounts of raw steel, aluminum, steel scrap, pig iron, electricity, coke, natural gas, sheet and formed steel, bearings, purchased components, fasteners, silicon sand, binders, sand additives, coated sand, and tube steel. fluctuations in the delivery of these materials may be driven by the supply/demand relationship for material, factors particular to that material or governmental regulation for raw materials such as electricity and natural gas. in addition, if any of our suppliers seeks bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue its business as anticipated or we cannot renew our supply contracts on favorable terms, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected. fluctuations in prices and/or availability of the raw materials or purchased components used by us, which at times may be more pronounced during periods of higher truck builds, may affect our profitability and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, as described above, a shortening or elimination of our trade credit by our suppliers may affect our liquidity and cash flow and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. see "item 1a혰risk factors혰current economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may have material adverse effect on our industry, business and results of operations or financial condition."         we use substantial amounts of raw steel and aluminum in our production processes. although raw steel is generally available from a number of sources, we have obtained favorable sourcing by negotiating and entering into high-volume contracts with third parties with terms ranging from one to two years. we obtain raw steel and aluminum from various third-party suppliers. we may not be successful in renewing our supply contracts on favorable terms or at all. a substantial interruption in the supply of raw steel or aluminum or inability to obtain a supply of raw steel or aluminum on commercially desirable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we are not always able, and may not be able in the future, to pass on increases in the price of raw steel or aluminum to our customers on a timely basis or at all. in particular, when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow. any fluctuations in the price or availability of raw steel or 19 table of contents aluminum may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.         steel scrap and pig iron are also major raw materials used in our business to produce our wheel-end and industrial components. steel scrap is derived from, among other sources, junked automobiles, industrial scrap, railroad cars, agricultural and heavy machinery, and demolition steel scrap from obsolete structures, containers and machines. pig iron is a low-grade cast iron that is a product of smelting iron ore with coke and limestone in a blast furnace. the availability and price of steel scrap and pig iron are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including north american and international demand for steel scrap and pig iron, freight costs, speculation and foreign exchange rates. steel scrap and pig iron availability and price may also be subject to governmental regulation. we are not always able, and may not be able in the future, to pass on increases in the price of steel scrap and pig iron to our customers. in particular, when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and cash flow. any fluctuations in the price or availability of steel scrap or pig iron may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. see "item 1혰business혰raw materials and suppliers." our business is affected by the seasonality and regulatory nature of the industries and markets that we serve.         our operations are typically seasonal as a result of regular customer maintenance and model changeover shutdowns, which typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. this seasonality may result in decreased net sales and profitability during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, federal and state regulations (including engine emissions regulations, tariffs, import regulations and other taxes) may have a material adverse effect on our business and are beyond our control. cost reduction and quality improvement initiatives by oems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.         we are primarily a components supplier to the heavy- and medium-duty truck industries, which are characterized by a small number of oems that are able to exert considerable pressure on components suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality and provide additional design and engineering capabilities. given the fragmented nature of the industry, oems continue to demand and receive price reductions and measurable increases in quality through their use of competitive selection processes, rating programs, and various other arrangements. we may be unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions. oems may also seek to save costs by relocating production to countries with lower cost structures, which could in turn lead them to purchase components from local suppliers with lower production costs. additionally, oems have generally required component suppliers to provide more design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been absorbed by the suppliers. future price reductions, increased quality standards and additional engineering capabilities required by oems may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we operate in highly competitive markets.         the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. our products primarily compete on the basis of price, manufacturing and distribution capability, product design, product quality, product delivery and product service. some of our competitors are companies, or divisions, units or 20 table of contents subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. for these reasons, our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. in addition, our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than we can, or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving regulatory, industry, or customer requirements. as a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products. in addition, oems may expand their internal production of components, shift sourcing to other suppliers, or take other actions that could reduce the market for our products and have a negative impact on our business. we may encounter increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new competitors. we expect these competitive pressures in our markets to remain strong. see "item 1혰business혰competition."         in addition, potential competition from foreign truck components suppliers, especially in the aftermarket, may lead to an increase in truck components imports into north america, adversely affecting our market share and negatively affecting our ability to compete. at present, competition from non-u.s. manufacturers is constrained in the markets in which we compete due to factors such as high shipping costs. however, if the cost of fuel goes down, shipping costs would be significantly reduced, increasing the likelihood that foreign manufacturers will seek to increase their sales of track components in north american markets. foreign truck components suppliers, including those in china, may in the future increase their currently modest share of the markets for truck components in which we compete. some of these foreign suppliers may be owned, controlled or subsidized by their governments, and their decisions with respect to production, sales and exports may be influenced more by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions. in addition, foreign truck components suppliers may be subject to less restrictive regulatory and environmental regimes that could provide them with a cost advantage relative to north american suppliers. therefore, there is a risk that some foreign suppliers, including those in china, may increase their sales of truck components in north american markets despite decreasing profit margins or losses. if future trade cases do not provide relief from such potential trade practices, u.s. protective trade laws are weakened or international demand for trucks and/or truck components decreases, an increase of truck component imports into the united states may occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we face exposure to foreign business and operational risks including foreign exchange rate fluctuations and if we were to experience a substantial fluctuation, our profitability may change.         in the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the canadian dollar. from time to time, we use forward foreign exchange contracts, and other derivative instruments, to help offset the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities. we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contract instruments open at december 31, 2010. factors that could further impact the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates include the accuracy of our sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of derivative instruments. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk혰foreign currency risk." in addition, changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may not be able to continue to meet our customers' demands for our products and services.         we must continue to meet our customers' demand for our products and services. however, we may not be successful in doing so. if our customers' demand for our products and/or services exceeds our ability to meet that demand, we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the products and/or services they require to meet their business needs. factors that could result in our inability to 21 table of contents meet customer demands include an unforeseen spike in demand for our products and/or services, a failure by one or more of our suppliers to supply us with the raw materials and other resources that we need to operate our business effectively or poor management of our company or one or more divisions or units of our company, among other factors. our ability to provide our customers with products and services in a reliable and timely manner, in the quantity and quality desired and with a high level of customer service, may be severely diminished as a result. if this happens, we may lose some or all of our customers to one or more of our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.         in addition, it is important that we continue to meet our customers' demands in the truck components industry for product innovation, improvement and enhancement, including the continued development of new-generation products, design improvements and innovations that improve the quality and efficiency of our products. developing product innovations for the truck components industry has been and will continue to be a significant part of our strategy. however, such development will require us to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing. our recent financial condition has constrained our ability to make such investments. in the future, we may not have sufficient resources to make such necessary investments, or we may be unable to make the technological advances necessary to carry out product innovations sufficient to meet our customers' demands. we are also subject to the risks generally associated with product development, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. we may, as a result of these factors, be unable to meaningfully focus on product innovation as a strategy and may therefore be unable to meet our customers' demand for product innovation. equipment failures, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns.         we manufacture our products at 15 facilities and provide logistical services at our just-in-time sequencing facilities in the united states. an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of these facilities as a result of equipment failure or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products, which would reduce our net sales and earnings for the affected period. in the event of a stoppage in production at any of our facilities, even if only temporary, or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control, delivery times to our customers could be severely affected. any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future sales. our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. we may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failure, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may incur potential product liability, warranty and product recall costs.         we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability, warranty and product recall claims in the event any of our products results in property damage, personal injury or death, or does not conform to specifications. we may not be able to continue to maintain suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts on acceptable terms that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. in addition, if any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products. we have an ongoing product recall campaign related to automatic slack adjusters manufactured by our gunite business unit, and have recorded reserves in 2010, related thereto. a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 22 table of contents work stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or at our customers' facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.         as of december 31, 2010, unions represented approximately 57% of our workforce. as a result, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. any prolonged strike or other work stoppage at any one of our principal unionized facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have collective bargaining agreements with different unions at various facilities. these collective bargaining agreements expire at various times over the next few years, with the exception of our union contract at our monterrey, mexico facility, which expires on an annual basis. the 2011 negotiations in monterrey were successfully completed prior to the expiration of our union contract and the contract at our elkhart, indiana facility was extended through april 2012. in 2011, we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at our brillion and livermore facilities. any failure by us to reach a new agreement upon expiration of other union contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.         in addition, if any of our customers experience a material work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. this could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur substantial liabilities.         our operations, facilities, and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. the violation of such laws can result in significant fines, penalties, liabilities or restrictions on operations. from time to time, we are involved in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental, health and safety matters, and have in the past incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters. for example, we are involved in proceedings regarding alleged violations of air regulations at our rockford facility and stormwater regulations at our brillion facility, which could subject us to fines, penalties or other liabilities. in connection with such matters, we are negotiating with state authorities regarding certain capital improvements related to the underlying allegations. based on current information, we do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions; however, we cannot assure you that these or any other future environmental compliance matters will not have such an effect.         in addition to environmental laws that regulate our ongoing operations, we are also subject to environmental remediation liability. under the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") and analogous state laws, we may be liable as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment regardless of when the release occurred. we are currently involved in several matters relating to the investigation and/or remediation of locations where we have arranged for the disposal of foundry and other wastes. such matters include situations in which we have been named or are believed to be potentially responsible parties in connection with the contamination of these sites. additionally, environmental remediation may be required to address soil and groundwater contamination identified at certain of our facilities.         as of december 31, 2010, we had an environmental reserve of approximately $1.5 million, related primarily to our foundry operations. this reserve is based on management's review of potential liabilities as well as cost estimates related thereto. the reserve takes into account the benefit of a contractual indemnity given to us by a prior owner of our wheel-end subsidiary. the failure of the 23 table of contents indemnitor to fulfill its obligations could result in future costs that may be material. any expenditures required for us to comply with applicable environmental laws and/or pay for any remediation efforts will not be reduced or otherwise affected by the existence of the environmental reserve. our environmental reserve may not be adequate to cover our future costs related to the sites associated with the environmental reserve, and any additional costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the discovery of additional environmental issues, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the promulgation of new ones, more vigorous enforcement by regulators, the imposition of joint and several liability under cercla or analogous state laws, or other unanticipated events could also result in a material adverse effect.         the iron and steel foundry national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants ("neshap") was developed pursuant to section 112(d) of the clean air act and requires major sources of hazardous air pollutants to install controls representative of maximum achievable control technology. based on currently available information, we do not anticipate material costs regarding compliance with the neshap; however, if we are found to be out of compliance with the neshap, we could incur liability that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. see "item 1혰business혰environmental matters." future climate change regulation may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur substantial liabilities.         many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased emissions of greenhouse gases ("ghgs"), which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghgs. there are bills pending in congress that would limit and reduce ghg emissions through a cap-and-trade system of allowances and credits, under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions. in addition, in late 2009, the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") promulgated a rule requiring certain emitters of ghgs to monitor and report data with respect to their ghg emissions and in june 2010 promulgated a rule regarding future regulation of ghg emissions from stationary sources. also, several states, including states in which we have facilities, are considering or have begun to implement various ghg registration and reduction programs. certain of our facilities use significant amounts of energy and may emit amounts of ghgs above certain existing and/or proposed regulatory thresholds. ghg laws and regulations could increase the price of the energy we purchase, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions, require us to monitor and report our ghg emissions or require us to install new emission controls at our facilities, any one of which could significantly increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, future efforts to curb transportation-related ghgs could result in a lower demand for our products, which could negatively affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. while future ghg regulation appears increasingly likely, it is difficult to predict how these regulations will affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our warrants are not listed on any securities exchange and, as a result, our warrants may be less liquid than they otherwise would be if listed on a securities exchange.         our warrants are not listed on any securities exchange. instead, our warrants are currently traded over-the-counter on the otc bulletin board ("otcbb"). over-the-counter transactions involve risks in addition to those associated with transactions in securities traded on a securities exchange. many over-the-counter securities trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than exchange-listed securities. accordingly, our warrants may be less liquid than they would otherwise be and may be difficult to sell. also, the values of these securities may be more volatile than exchange-listed securities. in addition, issuers of securities traded on the otcbb do not have to meet the same specific quantitative and qualitative listing and maintenance standards. 24 table of contents we might fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, or third parties might assert that our technologies infringe on their intellectual property.         the protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to provide protection in this regard, but this protection might be inadequate. for example, our pending or future trademark, copyright, and patent applications might not be approved or, if allowed, they might not be of sufficient strength or scope. conversely, third parties might assert that our technologies or other intellectual property infringe on their proprietary rights. any intellectual property-related litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts and, whether or not we are ultimately successful, the litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. see "item 1혰business혰intellectual property." litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.         we are regularly subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as workers' compensation claims, osha investigations, employment disputes, unfair labor practice charges, customer and supplier disputes, and product liability claims arising out of the conduct of our business. litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. if a person unaffiliated with us were to acquire a substantial amount of our common stock, a change of control could occur.         if a person is able to acquire a substantial amount of our common stock, a change of control could be triggered under delaware general corporation law, our abl credit facility, or the indenture governing our senior notes. if a change of control under our abl credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes was to occur, we would need to obtain a waiver from our lenders or noteholders, as applicable, or amend these debt instruments. otherwise, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, could accelerate the debt outstanding under these debt instruments. if we are unable to obtain a waiver or otherwise refinance this debt, our liquidity and capital resources would be significantly limited, and our business operations could be materially and adversely impacted. if we fail to retain our executive officers, our business could be harmed.         our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers. their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly contribute to the success of our business and our results of operations. the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. all of our executive officers are at will, but each of them has a severance agreement, as discussed directly below. in addition, our future success and profitability will also depend, in part, upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel throughout our company. we have entered into typical severance arrangements with certain of our senior management employees, which may result in certain costs associated with strategic alternatives.         severance and retention agreements with certain senior management employees provide that the participating executive is entitled to a regular severance payment if we terminate the participating executive's employment without "cause" or if the participating executive terminates his or her employment with us for "good reason" (as these terms are defined in the agreement) at any time other than during a "protection period." the regular severance benefit is equal to the participating executive's base salary for one year. see "item 10혰directors and executive officers of the registrant." 25 table of contents a protection period begins on the date on which a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement) occurs and ends 18 months after a "change in control." a change in control within the meaning of the agreements occurred as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization for all then outstanding severance and retention agreements, which did not include the severance and retention agreements with mr. dauch and mr. woodward entered into after our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.         the change in control severance benefit is payable to an executive if his or her employment is terminated during the protection period either by the participating executive for "good reason" or by us without "cause." the change in control severance benefits for tier ii executives (messrs. dauch, maniatis, schomer, woodward and wright) consist of a payment equal to 200% of the executive's salary plus 200% of the greater of (i) the annualized incentive compensation to which the executive would be entitled as of the date on which the change of control occurs or (ii) the average incentive compensation award over the three years prior to termination. the change in control severance benefits for tier iii executives (other key executives) consist of a payment equal to 100% of the executive's salary and 100% of the greater of (i) the annualized incentive compensation to which the executive would be entitled as of the date on which the change of control occurs or (ii) the average incentive compensation award over the three years prior to termination. if the participating executive's termination occurs during the protection period, the severance and retention agreement also provides for the continuance of certain other benefits, including reimbursement for forfeitures under qualified plans and continued health, disability, accident and dental insurance coverage for the lesser of 18 months (or 12 months in the case of tier iii executives) from the date of termination or the date on which the executive receives such benefits from a subsequent employer. there are currently no tier i executive with severance and retention agreements.         neither the regular severance benefit nor the change in control severance benefit is payable if we terminate the participating executive's employment for "cause," if the executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment without "good reason" or if the executive's employment is terminated as a result of disability or death. any payments to which the participating executive may be entitled under the agreement will be reduced by the full amount of any payments to which the executive may be entitled due to termination under any other severance policy offered by us. these agreements would make it costly for us to terminate certain of our senior management employees and such costs may also discourage potential acquisition proposals, which may negatively affect our stock price. our products may be rendered obsolete or less attractive by changes in regulatory, legislative or industry requirements.         changes in regulatory, legislative or industry requirements may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. our ability to anticipate changes in these requirements, especially changes in regulatory standards, will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. we may not be able to comply in the future with new regulatory, legislative and/or industrial standards that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and certain of our products may, as a result, become obsolete or less attractive to our customers. our strategic initiatives may be unsuccessful, may take longer than anticipated, or may result in unanticipated costs.         future strategic initiatives could include divestitures, acquisitions, and restructurings, the success and timing of which will depend on various factors. many of these factors are not in our control. in addition, the ultimate benefit of any acquisition would depend on the successful integration of the acquired entity or assets into our existing business. failure to successfully identify, complete, and/or integrate future strategic initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 26 table of contents         additionally, our strategy contemplates significant growth in international markets in which we have significantly less market share and experience than we have in our domestic operations and markets. an inability to penetrate these international markets could adversely affect our results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness our leverage and debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.         as of december 31, 2010, our total indebtedness was $310.0 million. our indebtedness and debt service obligations could have important negative consequences to us, including: 혮 difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; 혮 difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; 혮 increased vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions; 혮 limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; 혮 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, and 혮 limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry. despite our leverage, we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur more indebtedness. this could further exacerbate the risk immediately described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness.         we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. although our abl credit facility and indenture governing our senior notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. for example, we may incur additional debt to, among other things, finance future acquisitions, expand through internal growth, fund our working capital needs, comply with regulatory requirements, respond to competition or for general financial reasons alone. to the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the risks described above would increase. to service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.         our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.         our business may not, however, generate sufficient cash flow from operations. our currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule. also, future borrowings may not be available to us under our abl credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional equity capital or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. we are unable to predict the timing of such sales or the proceeds which we could realize from such sales, or whether we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 27 table of contents risks related to our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings our actual financial results may vary significantly from the projections filed with the bankruptcy court, and investors should not rely on the projections.         neither the projected financial information that we previously filed with the bankruptcy court in connection with the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings nor the financial information included in the disclosure statement filed with the bankruptcy court in conjunction with our chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings (the "disclosure statement") should be considered or relied on in connection with the purchase of our common stock, warrants, or other securities. we were required to prepare projected financial information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. this projected financial information was filed with the bankruptcy court as part of our disclosure statement approved by the bankruptcy court. the projections reflect numerous assumptions concerning anticipated future performance and prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and continue to be beyond our control and that may not materialize. projections are inherently subject to uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks. our actual results will vary from those contemplated by the projections for a variety of reasons including the subsequent sales of assets related to our farm equipment and seating product lines. furthermore, the projections were limited by the information available to us as of the date of the preparation of the projections, including production forecasts published by act publications which have been substantially revised (the revised numbers being included in this report). therefore, variations from the projections may be material, and investors should not rely on such projections. because of the adoption of fresh-start accounting and the effects of the transactions contemplated by the plan of reorganization, financial information subsequent to february 26, 2010, will not be comparable to financial information prior to february 26, 2010.         upon our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions of asc 852, reorganizations, pursuant to which the midpoint of the range of our reorganization value was allocated to our assets and liabilities in conformity with the procedures specified by asc 805, business combinations. accordingly, our consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of operations subsequent to february 26, 2010, will not be comparable in many respects to our consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of operations prior to february 26, 2010. the lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our capital stock. our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings may limit our ability to offset future u.s. taxable income with tax losses and credits incurred prior to emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.         in connection with our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, we were able to retain a portion of our u.s. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (collectively, the "tax attributes"). however, internal revenue code ("irc") sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes against future u.s. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings is considered a change in ownership for purposes of irc section 382. in our situation, the limitation under the irc will be based on the value of our common stock on or around the time of emergence, and increased to take into account the recognition of built-in gains. as a result, our future u.s. taxable income may not be fully offset by the tax attributes if such income exceeds our annual limitation, and we may incur a tax liability with respect to such income. in addition, subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the irc could further diminish our ability to utilize tax attributes. 28 table of contents we may be subject to claims that were not discharged in the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.         substantially all of the claims against us that arose prior to the date of our bankruptcy filing were resolved during our chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings or are in the process of being resolved in the bankruptcy court as part of the claims reconciliation process. although we anticipate that the remaining claims will be handled in due course with no material adverse effect to our business, financial operations or financial conditions, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that the resolution of such claims will occur in a timely manner or at all. subject to certain exceptions (such as certain employee and customer claims) and as set forth in the plan of reorganization, all claims against and interests in us and our domestic subsidiaries that arose prior to the initiation of our chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings are (1) subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (2) discharged, in accordance with the bankruptcy code and terms of the plan of reorganization. pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization, the provisions of the plan of reorganization constitute a good faith compromise or settlement of all such claims and the entry of the order confirming the plan of reorganization or other orders resolving objections to claims constitute the bankruptcy court's approval of the compromise or settlement arrived at with respect to all such claims. circumstances in which claims and other obligations that arose prior to our bankruptcy filing may not have been discharged include instances where a claimant had inadequate notice of the bankruptcy filing. item 1b.    unresolved
