“seek,” “should,” “target,” “would” or similar expressions. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. while we believe that our expectations are reasonable in view of the information that we currently have, these expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are numerous factors—many beyond our control—that could cause actual results to vary materially from these expectations. such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in price, supply and demand for natural gas and related products; the impact of changes in state and federal legislation and regulation, including any changes related to climate matters; actions taken by government agencies on rates and other matters; concentration of credit risk; utility and energy industry consolidation; the impact on cost and timeliness of construction projects by government and other approvals, development project delays, adequacy of supply of diversified vendors, and unexpected change in project costs, including the cost of funds to finance these projects and our ability to recover our project costs from our customers; limits on pipeline capacity; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, including recent acquisitions in our retail operations segment; our ability to successfully integrate operations that we have or may acquire or develop in the future; direct or indirect effects on our business, financial condition or liquidity resulting from a change in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our counterparties or competitors; interest rate fluctuations; financial market conditions, including disruptions in the capital markets and lending environment; general economic conditions; uncertainties about environmental issues and the related impact of such issues, including our environmental remediation plans; the impact of the new depreciation rates for nicor gas; the impact of changes in weather, including climate change, on the temperature-sensitive portions of our business; the impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, on the supply and price of natural gas and on our cargo shipping business; acts of war or terrorism; the outcome of litigation; and the factors described in this item 1a “risk factors” and the other factors discussed in our filings with the sec. there also may be other factors that we do not anticipate or that we do not recognize are material that could cause results to differ materially from expectations. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law. glossary 15 table of contents risks related to our business risks related to the regulation of our businesses could affect the rates we are able to charge, our costs and our profitability. we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. in particular, at the federal level our businesses are regulated by the ferc. at the state level, our businesses are regulated by regulatory authorities in illinois, georgia, virginia, new jersey, florida, tennessee and maryland. these authorities regulate many aspects of our operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, rights of way, operations, safety, rates that we charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of costs associated with our regulatory infrastructure projects, including our pipeline replacement program and environmental remediation activities, energy efficiency programs, relationships with our affiliates, franchise agreements and carrying costs we charge marketers selling retail natural gas in georgia for gas held in storage for their customer accounts. our ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain our current rates of return and recover regulatory assets and liabilities recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance related to regulated operations depends on regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue receiving our currently authorized rates of return including the recovery of our regulatory assets and liabilities, or that the commissions will deem all costs, including capital costs, as prudently incurred. we could incur significant compliance costs if we are required to adjust to new regulations. in addition, as the regulatory environment for our industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, whether existing or new, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate our operations, or otherwise be subject to material costs and liabilities. we are subject to environmental regulation and our costs to comply are significant. any changes in existing environmental regulation could affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations associated with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of mgp residuals and waste in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. our current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to our results of operations and financial condition. failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. we are generally responsible for liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the natural gas assets that we have operated, acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are or were known or unknown. in addition, in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. before natural gas was widely available, we manufactured gas from coal and other fuels. those manufacturing operations were known as mgps, which we ceased operating in the 1950s. for more information regarding these obligations, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 herein. in addition, claims against us under environmental laws and regulations could result in material costs and liabilities. existing environmental laws and regulations also could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities. with the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated by us subject to environmental regulation, our environmental expenditures could increase in the future, and such expenditures may not be fully recoverable from our customers. additionally, the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions could give rise to expenditures and liabilities, including fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. our infrastructure improvement and customer growth may be restricted by the capital-intensive nature of our business. we must construct additions and replacements to our natural gas distribution systems to continue the expansion of our customer base and improve system reliability, especially during peak usage. we also may need to construct expansions of our existing natural gas storage facilities or develop and construct new natural gas storage facilities. the cost of such construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining government and other approvals, project delays, adequacy of supply of vendors, vendor performance, or unexpected changes in project costs. weather, general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost, the projected construction schedule and the completion timeline of a project. our cash flows may not be fully adequate to finance the cost of such construction. as a result, we may be required to fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowings or the issuance of common stock, or both. for our distribution operations segment, this may limit our ability to expand our infrastructure to connect new customers due to limits on the amount we can economically invest, which shifts costs to potential customers and may make it uneconomical for them to connect to our distribution systems. for our natural gas storage business, this may significantly reduce our earnings and return on investment from what would be expected for this business, or it may impair our ability to complete the expansions or development projects. glossary 16 table of contents we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change and associated legislation and regulation. climate change is expected to receive increasing attention from the current federal administration, non-governmental organizations and legislators. debate continues as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. the epa has begun using provisions of the clean air act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. thus far, epa has imposed greenhouse gas regulations on automobiles and implemented new permitting requirements for the construction or modification of major stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including natural gas-fired power plants. in addition, president obama issued a presidential memorandum on june 25, 2013, directing epa to adopt performance standards to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. specifically, the presidential memorandum directs epa to propose standards for future power plants by september 20, 2013 and propose regulations and emission guidelines for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by june 1, 2014. the presidential memorandum directs epa to finalize those regulations by june 1, 2015. states would be required to develop regulations implementing the epa’s guidelines by june 30, 2016. it also includes a wide variety of other initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to address climate change. the outcome of federal and state actions to address climate change could potentially result in new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions, which in turn could: ·   result in increased costs associated with our operations, ·   increase other costs to our business, ·   affect the demand for natural gas (positively or negatively), and ·   impact the prices we charge our customers and affect the competitive position of natural gas. because natural gas is a fossil fuel with low carbon content, it is likely that future carbon constraints will create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. the impact is already being seen in the power production sector due to both environmental regulations and low natural gas costs. any adoption by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. our gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, including third party damages, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. glossary 17 table of contents we face increasing competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our revenues, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may limit our ability to grow our business. the natural gas business is highly competitive, increasingly complex, and we are facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy, including electric companies, oil and propane providers and, in some cases, energy marketing and trading companies. in particular, the success of our retail businesses is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing retail natural gas services in our service territories, most notably in illinois and georgia. natural gas competes with other forms of energy. the primary competitive factor is price. changes in the price or availability of natural gas relative to other forms of energy and the ability of end-users to convert to alternative fuels affect the demand for natural gas. in the case of commercial, industrial and agricultural customers, adverse economic conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could also cause these customers to bypass or disconnect from our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. our retail operations segment markets fixed-price and fixed-bill contracts that protect customers against higher natural gas prices, or protect customers against both higher natural gas prices and colder weather. the sale of these fixed-price contracts may be adversely affected if natural gas prices are, or are perceived to be, low and stable. our retail operations segment also faces risks in the form of price, convenience and service competition from other warranty and hvac companies. retail services also bears risk from potential changes in the regulatory environment. our wholesale services segment competes with national and regional full-service energy providers, energy merchants and producers and pipelines for sales based on our ability to aggregate competitively priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity. some of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more national and global exposure than we do. the consolidation of this industry and the pricing to gain market share may affect our operating margin. we expect this trend to continue in the near term, and the increasing competition for asset management deals could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related operating margin available in this portion of sequent’s business. our midstream operations segment competes with natural gas facilities in the gulf coast region of the u.s. as the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in north america are located in the gulf coast region. competition for our central valley storage facility in northern california primarily consists of storage facilities in northern california and western north america. storage values have declined over the past several years due to low gas prices and low volatility and we expect this to continue in 2014. our cargo shipping segment competes with international maritime companies. the current expansion of the panama canal, which is expected to be completed and open for commercial ship transit in 2015, may lead to increased competition as larger vessels may gain access to the caribbean. in addition, the growing development of the global logistic environment has moved away from port-to-port operations and towards the combined transport supply chain of various combinations of road, rail, sea and inland waterways. globally, this has resulted in the need to improve ship productivity, sometimes via third party ship management, development of hub and spoke systems, larger ships, faster ship turnaround time and increased use of technology. additionally, there are increased pricing pressures and decreased shipping volumes for the islands that tropical shipping currently serves. increased competition may affect our volumes, market share, pricing structure and operating margin. tropical shipping does not have fuel contracts, but reduces its fuel price risk through fuel surcharges. tropical shipping has five primary competitors that serve the same major areas, some of which are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more global exposure than we do. changes or downturns in the economy could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results. the overall economy in the u.s. has a significant impact on the financial well-being of many households in the u.s. as a result, changes or downturns in the u.s. economy could cause our customers to use less gas in future heating seasons and it may become more difficult for them to pay their natural gas bills. this may slow collections and lead to higher-than-normal levels of accounts receivables, bad debt and financing requirements. sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns. the manufacturing industry in the u.s. is subject to changing market conditions including international competition, fluctuating product demand and increased costs and regulation. tropical shipping’s business consists primarily of the shipment of building materials, food and other necessities from the u.s. and canada to developers, distributors and residents in the bahamas and the caribbean region, as well as tourist-related shipments intended for use in hotels, resorts and on cruise ships. as a result, tropical shipping’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition can be significantly affected by adverse general economic conditions in the u.s., bahamas, caribbean region and canada. also, a shift in buying patterns that results in such goods being sourced directly from other parts of the world, including china and india, rather than the u.s. and canada, could significantly affect tropical shipping’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. glossary 18 table of contents a significant portion of our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks, due in part to a concentration of credit risk at nicor gas, atlanta gas light, southstar and sequent. nicor gas and sequent often extend credit to their counterparties. despite performing credit analyses prior to extending credit and seeking to effectuate netting agreements, nicor gas and sequent are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral nicor gas or sequent has secured is inadequate, they could experience material financial losses. further, sequent has a concentration of credit risk, which could subject a significant portion of its credit exposure to collection risks. most of this concentration is with counterparties that are either load-serving utilities or end-use customers that have supplied some level of credit support. default by any of these counterparties in their obligations to pay amounts due to sequent could result in credit losses that would negatively impact our wholesale services segment. we have accounts receivable collection risks in georgia due to a concentration of credit risks related to the provision of natural gas services to marketers. at december 31, 2013, atlanta gas light provided services to 12 certificated and active marketers in georgia. as a result, atlanta gas light depends on a concentrated number of customers for revenues. agl resources provides a guarantee to atlanta gas light as security support for southstar. additionally, southstar markets directly to end-use customers and has periodically experienced credit losses as a result of severe cold weather or high prices for natural gas that increase customers’ bills and, consequently, impair customers’ ability to pay. for more information, see item 7a, “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under the caption “credit risk” herein. the asset management arrangements between sequent and our local distribution companies, and between sequent and its non-affiliated customers, may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels, which could have a significant impact on sequent’s business. sequent currently manages the storage and transportation assets of our affiliates atlanta gas light, virginia natural gas, elizabethtown gas, florida city gas, chattanooga gas and elkton gas. the profits it earns from the management of those assets with these affiliates are shared with their respective customers and for atlanta gas light with the georgia commission’s universal service fund, with the exception of chattanooga gas and elkton gas where sequent is assessed annual fixed-fees. entry into and renewal of these agreements are subject to regulatory approval. the agreements with elizabethtown gas and elkton gas expire in march 2014 and we cannot predict whether such agreements will be renewed or the terms of such renewal. sequent also has asset management agreements with certain non-affiliated customers. sequent’s results could be significantly impacted if these agreements are not renewed or are amended or renewed with less favorable terms. sustained low natural gas prices could reduce the demand for these types of asset management arrangements. we are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services, midstream operations and retail operations. the commodity, storage and transportation portfolios at sequent and the commodity and storage portfolios at midstream operations and southstar consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas commodities, including contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate, we could experience financial losses from our trading activities. for more information, see item 7a, “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under the caption “value-at-risk” herein. our accounting results may not be indicative of the risks we are taking or the economic results we expect for wholesale services. although sequent enters into various contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations, the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges does not always correspond to the profits or losses on the item being hedged. the difference in accounting can result in volatility in sequent’s reported results, even though the expected operating margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were initiated. changes in weather conditions may affect our earnings. weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a large impact on our earnings. severe weather conditions can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system. extended mild weather, during either the winter or summer period, can have a significant impact on demand for and cost of natural gas. at nicor gas, approximately 50% of all usage is for space heating and approximately 75% of the usage and revenues occur from october through march. weather fluctuations have the potential to significantly impact year-to-year comparisons of operating income and cash flow. we estimate that a 100 degree-day variation from normal weather of 5,729 heating degree days impacts nicor gas’ margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1 million under its current rate structure. for our illinois weather risk associated with nicor gas, we implemented a corporate weather hedging program in the second quarter of 2013 that utilizes otc weather derivatives to reduce the risk of lower operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather in illinois. for more information, see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “natural gas price volatility” and the subheading “hedges” and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 herein. we have wna mechanisms for virginia natural gas, elizabethtown gas and chattanooga gas that partially offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on residential and commercial customer billings and on our operating margin. at elizabethtown gas we could be required to return a portion of any wna surcharge to its customers if elizabethtown gas’ return on equity exceeds its authorized return on equity of 10.3%. glossary 19 table of contents these wna regulatory mechanisms are most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using historical averages. the protection afforded by the wna depends on continued regulatory approval. the loss of this continued regulatory approval could make us more susceptible to weather-related earnings fluctuations. we also have decoupled, including straight-fixed-variable, rate designs at atlanta gas light, virginia natural gas and chattanooga gas, which allow for the recovery of fixed customer service costs separately from assumed natural gas volumes used by our customers. for more information, see item 1, “business” under the caption “rate structures” herein. changes in weather conditions also may impact southstar’s earnings. as a result, southstar uses a variety of weather derivative instruments to stabilize the impact on its operating margin in the event of warmer or colder-than-normal weather in the winter months. however, these instruments do not fully protect southstar’s earnings from the effects of unusually warm or cold weather. wholesale services’ earnings are impacted by changes in weather conditions as weather impacts the demand for natural gas and volatility in the natural gas market. the volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on our customer rates, our long-term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. the volatility of natural gas prices in 2013 was higher relative to 2011 and 2012 due to colder weather and supply constraints in the northeast corridor but relative to periods prior to 2011, generally it was significantly lower in part due to mild hurricane seasons and mild summer and winter weather. through the acquisition of natural gas and hedging of natural gas prices, wholesale services reduces the risk to its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. tropical shipping’s operations are affected by weather conditions in florida, canada, the bahamas and caribbean regions. during hurricane season in the summer and fall, tropical shipping may be subject to revenue loss, higher operating expenses, business interruptions, delays, and ship, equipment and facilities damage which could adversely affect tropical shipping’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, seven seas’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected due to increased insured losses relating to claims arising from hurricane-related events. our retail energy businesses in illinois, nicor solutions and nicor advanced energy, offer utility-bill management products that mitigate and/or eliminate the risks to customers of variations in weather and we hedge this risk to reduce any adverse effect to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. a decrease in the availability of adequate pipeline transportation capacity due to weather conditions could reduce our revenues and profits. our gas supply for our distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations segments depends on availability of adequate pipeline transportation and storage capacity. we purchase a substantial portion of our gas supply from interstate sources. interstate pipeline companies transport the gas to our system. a decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation and storage service could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas or cause rates to fluctuate. our profitability may decline if the counterparties to sequent’s asset management transactions fail to perform in accordance with sequent’s agreements. sequent focuses on capturing the value from idle or underutilized energy assets, typically by executing transactions that balance the needs of various markets and time horizons. sequent is exposed to the risk that counterparties to our transactions will not perform their obligations. should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements, honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices or return a significant portion of the consideration received for gas. in such events, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to or received from counterparties. inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our ability to control operating expenses and costs, increase our level of indebtedness and adversely impact our customer base. inflation has caused increases in certain operating costs. we attempt to control costs in part through implementation of best practices and business process improvements, many of which are facilitated through investments in information systems and technology. we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates. historically, we have been able to control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates, and we intend to continue to do so. however, any inability by us to control our expenses in a reasonable manner would adversely influence our future results. rapid increases in the price of purchased gas could cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher-than-normal accounts receivable. this situation results in higher short-term debt levels and increased bad debt expense. should the price of purchased gas increase significantly, we would expect increases in our short-term debt, accounts receivable and bad debt expense. finally, higher costs of natural gas can cause our utility customers to conserve their use of our gas services or switch to other competing products. higher natural gas costs may increase competition from products utilizing alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas fueled equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. glossary 20 table of contents the cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changes in liabilities as a result of updated demographics and assumptions. these changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. the cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics and assumptions, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and changes in health care cost trends. any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may have a material adverse effect on the value of our pension plan assets. in these circumstances, we may be required to recognize an increased pension expense and a charge to our other comprehensive income to the extent that the actual return on assets in the pension fund is less than the expected return. we may be required to make additional contributions in future periods in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and in accordance with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 (pension protection act). for more information, see item 7, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “contractual obligations and commitments” and the subheading “pension and other retirement plans” and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 herein. natural disasters, pandemic illness, material misconduct, terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businesses. natural disasters may damage our assets and interrupt our business operations. pandemic illness could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. an employee or third party may purposely, or inadvertently, fail to adhere to our policies and procedures or our policies and procedures may not be effective; this could result in the violation of a law or regulation, a material error or misstatement, damage to our reputation or the incurrence of substantial expense. the threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the u.s. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. in addition, future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the u.s., and companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism. these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks. the insurance industry has also been disrupted by these events. as a result, the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and our competitors typically insure may be limited or may be insufficient. in addition, the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. a work stoppage could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. certain of our businesses are dependent upon employees who are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these agreements may increase our costs, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and benefits and limit our ability to implement efficiency-related improvements. disputes with the unions could result in work stoppages that could impact the delivery of natural gas and other services, which could strain relationships with customers, vendors and regulators. we believe that we have a good working relationship with our unionized employees and we remain committed to work in good faith with the unions to renew or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements that balance the needs of the company and our employees. for more information, see item 1, “business” under the caption “employees” herein. changes in the laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by our retail operations segment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our retail operations segment provides various energy-related products and services. these include sales of natural gas and utility-bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, and the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment. the sale and marketing of these products and services are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on or restrict or prohibit certain activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in 1997, georgia enacted legislation allowing deregulation of gas distribution operations. to date, georgia is the only state in the nation that has fully deregulated gas distribution operations, which ultimately resulted in atlanta gas light exiting the retail natural gas sales business while retaining its gas distribution operations. marketers, including our majority-owned subsidiary, southstar, then assumed the retail gas sales responsibility at deregulated prices. the deregulation process required atlanta gas light to completely reorganize its operations and personnel at significant expense. we are not aware of any movement to do so, but it is possible that the legislature could reverse or amend portions of the deregulation process. glossary 21 table of contents changes in the laws and regulations regarding maritime activities offered by our cargo shipping segment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. tropical shipping is subject to the international ship and port facility security code and is also subject to the u.s. maritime transportation security act, both of which require extensive security assessments, plans and procedures. tropical shipping is also subject to the regulations of the federal maritime commission, the surface transportation board, as well as other federal agencies and local laws, where applicable. additional costs that could result from changes in the rules and regulations of these regulatory agencies would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. conservation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. as a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives on energy conservation, we have put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by our customers. funding for such programs is being recovered through cost recovery riders. however, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. a security breach could disrupt our operating systems, shutdown our facilities or expose confidential personal information. security breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism, could lead to system disruptions or generate facility shutdowns. if such an attack or security breach were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in addition, such an attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness, our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities. additionally, the protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. we had no material security breaches in 2013. we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. our international operations require us to comply with a number of u.s. and international laws and regulations, including those prohibiting certain payments to foreign officials. one of these laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), generally prohibits u.s. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. although our policies require compliance with these laws and we maintain a compliance training program designed to avoid violations, controlling the actions of our employees and the representatives of our international operations is difficult and violations may occur. for a discussion of an investigation of a potential violation of such laws, see item 3, “legal proceedings” herein. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. we may pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, the success of which may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in the past, we have pursued acquisitions to complement or expand our business, divestures and other strategic transactions. such future transactions are part of our general strategic objectives and may occur. if we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and substantial goodwill. acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common shares. we may be affected materially and adversely if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire in an efficient and effective manner. similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects. we assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. we assess our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. to the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. no impairment of goodwill was recorded as a result of our 2013 annual impairment testing as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value. additionally, no impairment of long-lived assets was recorded during 2013. glossary 22 table of contents since interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, as interest rates rise, the calculated fair values decrease and future impairments may occur. further, the rates for contracting capacity at jefferson island, golden triangle and central valley are also key components in the models used to estimate their fair value. consequently, a further decline in market fundamentals and the rates for contracting availability could result in future impairments. our cargo shipping segment also has goodwill and assets subject to impairment testing and while conditions are improving in this segment it has been adversely impacted by the weak global economy. due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, we cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. these assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples. for additional information, see item 7,”management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” herein. failure to recruit, retain and train an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and train employees. certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to current and future needs, or the availability of outside resources may lead to operational challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperience, or a lengthy training period. our costs, including productivity and safety costs, costs to replace employees, and costs as a result of errors may increase. failure to hire and adequately train employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. risks related to our corporate and financial structure we depend on our ability to successfully access the capital and financial markets. any inability to access the capital or financial markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we may rely on for future growth. we rely on access to both short-term money markets (in the form of commercial paper and lines of credit) and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations. if we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be negatively affected, and we may be forced to postpone, modify or cancel capital projects. certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. such market disruptions could result from: ·   adverse economic conditions; ·   adverse general capital market conditions; ·   poor performance and health of the utility industry in general; ·   bankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated energy companies or marketers; ·   significant decrease in the demand for natural gas; ·   adverse regulatory actions that affect our local gas distribution companies and our natural gas storage business; ·   terrorist attacks on our facilities or our suppliers; or ·   extreme weather conditions. the amount of our working capital requirements in the near-term will primarily depend on the market price of natural gas and weather. higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations. while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and our available sources of financing, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near-term. the future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results due to market disruptions could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above, or in ways that we do not currently anticipate. if we breach any of the financial covenants under our various credit facilities, our debt service obligations could be accelerated. the agl credit facility and the nicor gas credit facility contain financial covenants. if we breach any of the financial covenants under these agreements, our debt repayment obligations under them could be accelerated. in such event, we may not be able to refinance or repay all of our indebtedness, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. glossary 23 table of contents a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital, or may require us to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties. our senior debt is currently assigned investment grade credit ratings. if the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. in addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. additionally, if our credit rating by either s&p or moody’s falls to non-investment grade status, we would be required to provide additional collateral to continue conducting business with certain customers. in december 2012, fitch lowered the ratings of agl resources from a- to bbb+. there are no implications of this downgrade on our corporate funding ability or our ability to access the capital markets, nor does this downgrade trigger any collateralization requirements under our corporate guarantees. for additional credit rating and interest rate information, see item 7, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “liquidity and capital resources” and item 7a, “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under the caption “interest rate risk” herein. we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt, which could lead to changes in interest expense and adversely affect our earnings. we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. in order to maintain our desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. for additional information, see item 7a, “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under the caption “interest rate risk.” however, we may not structure these swap agreements in a manner that manages our risks effectively. if we are unable to do so, our earnings may be reduced. in addition, higher interest rates, all other things equal, reduce the earnings that we derive from transactions where we capture the difference between authorized returns and short-term borrowings. we are a holding company and are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, which may not be available in the amounts and at the times we need. a significant portion of our outstanding debt was issued by our wholly owned subsidiary, agl capital, which we fully and unconditionally guarantee. since we are a holding company and have no operations separate from our investment in our subsidiaries, we are dependent on the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or other distributions to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions is subject to applicable state law and regulatory restrictions. in addition, nicor gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. refer to item 5, “market for the registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information. our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds. the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations. we use derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, to manage our commodity and financial market risks. we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. in addition, derivative contracts entered for hedging purposes may not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. as a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the reported fair value of these contracts. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 introduced a comprehensive new framework for the regulation of otc derivatives, including the requirement that certain otc derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. the dodd-frank act required various regulatory agencies, including the commodity futures trading commission and the sec, to establish regulations for implementation of this requirement and many other provisions of the dodd-frank act. a number of those regulations have been adopted and we have enacted new procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations. in addition, based on current interpretation, we were not considered to be a “swap dealer” or “major swap participant” in 2013 so we are exempt from the clearing, exchange trading and certain other requirements under the dodd-frank act. if these provisions were to apply to our derivative activities, we could be subject to higher costs for our derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. in addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the otc derivatives provisions of the dodd-frank act by our swap counterparties could result in increased costs or additional collateral postings related to our derivative activities. we expect additional regulations to be issued, which should provide further clarity regarding the impact of this legislation on us, including any potential increased costs of our hedging activities. glossary 24 table of contents as a result of cross-default provisions in our borrowing arrangements, we may be unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part. the agl credit facility and the nicor gas credit facility contain cross-default provisions. should an event of default occur under some of our debt agreements, we face the prospect of being in default under our other debt agreements, obligated in such instance to satisfy a large portion of our outstanding indebtedness and unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations simultaneously. changes in taxation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. various tax and fee increases may occur in locations in which we operate. we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulation will be introduced, the form of any legislation or regulation, or whether any such legislation or regulation will be passed by the legislatures or other governmental bodies. new taxes or an increase in tax rates would increase tax expense and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. item 1b. unresolved
