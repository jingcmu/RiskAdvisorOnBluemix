item 1a. risk factors the following section includes the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. this discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. for cautions about relying on forward-looking statements, please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item 1. risks related to our business and operations our portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in california, oregon, washington, texas and hawaii, which may cause us to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. our properties are located in california, oregon, washington, texas and hawaii, and substantially all of our properties are concentrated in california, oregon, washington and hawaii, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. as a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic or other conditions in these markets (such as periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters that occur in these markets (such as earthquakes, wildfires and other events). for example, california, oregon, washington and hawaii experienced economic downturns in recent years. as such, our retail and office properties were impacted by these conditions. additionally, our properties in hawaii were impacted by the effects of reduced tourism in hawaii as a result of the economic downturn. if there is a further downturn in the economy in these markets, our operations and our revenue and cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay distributions to our stockholders, could be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of retail, office, mixed-use or multifamily properties. our operations may also be affected if competing properties are built in either of these markets. moreover, submarkets within any of our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. in addition, the state of california continues to suffer from severe budgetary constraints and is regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many other states, all of which may reduce demand for retail, office, mixed-use or multifamily space in california. any adverse economic or real estate developments in the california, oregon, washington or hawaii markets, or any decrease in demand for retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use space resulting from the regulatory environment, business climate or energy or fiscal problems, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. at december 31, 2012, we had total debt outstanding of $1,057.7 million, a substantial portion of which contains non-recourse carve-out guarantees and environmental indemnities from us and our operating partnership, and we may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities. we also have a revolving credit facility with a capacity of $250.0 million, with no balance outstanding at december 31, 2012. payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash   9 table of contents resources to operate our properties or to pay the dividends currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our reit qualification. our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following: our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;        we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to meet operational needs;        we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;        we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject;        we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and        our default under any loan with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness. if any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. furthermore, foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements imposed by the internal revenue code of 1986, or the code. we depend on significant tenants in our office properties, and a bankruptcy, insolvency or inability to pay rent of any of these tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our office properties and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2012, the three largest tenants in our office portfoliosalesforce.com, the veterans benefits administration and autodesk, inc.represented approximately 20.8% of the total annualized base rent in our office portfolio. salesforce.com, inc. is a provider of customer and collaboration relationship management services to various businesses and industries worldwide. the veterans benefits administration is a division of the u.s. department of veterans affairs and is responsible for administering financial and other forms of assistance to veterans and their dependents. autodesk, inc. is an american multinational corporation that focuses on 3-d design software for use in the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment industries. the inability of a significant tenant to pay rent or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our office properties. if a tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, federal law may prohibit us from evicting such tenant based solely upon such bankruptcy or insolvency. in addition, a bankrupt or insolvent tenant may be authorized to reject and terminate its lease with us. any claim against such tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. if any of these tenants were to experience a downturn in its business or a weakening of its financial condition resulting in its failure to make timely rental payments or causing it to default under its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. any such event could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. our retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants. our retail shopping center properties typically are anchored by large, nationally recognized tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken significantly their financial condition. as a result, our tenants, including our anchor and other major tenants, may fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, seek concessions in order to continue operations or declare bankruptcy, any of   10 table of contents which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. in addition, certain of our tenants may cease operations while continuing to pay rent, which could decrease customer traffic, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at the applicable retail property. in addition to these potential effects of a business downturn, mergers or consolidations among large retail establishments could result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations, which could include stores at our retail properties. loss of, or a store closure by, an anchor or major tenant could significantly reduce our occupancy level or the rent we receive from our retail properties, and we may not have the right to re-lease vacated space or we may be unable to re-lease vacated space at attractive rents or at all. moreover, in the event of default by a major tenant or anchor store, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves an anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations, could seriously harm our performance and could adversely affect the value of the applicable retail property. for example, sears holdings corporation, the parent company of sears roebuck and co. and kmart corporation, which leases retail space for a kmart store at one of our properties with an aggregate of 119,590 leased square feet for an aggregate annualized base rent of $3.8 million as of december 31, 2011 announced in early 2012 that it would close approximately 80 stores during the year. the loss of kmart as a tenant at our property could (1) decrease customer traffic for our other tenants at the property, thereby decreasing sales for such tenants and (2) make it more difficult for us to secure tenant lease renewals or new tenants for the property. as of december 31, 2012, our largest anchor tenants were lowes, kmart and foodland super market, which together represented approximately 15.0% of our total annualized base rent of our retail portfolio in the aggregate, and 6.0%, 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively, of the annualized base rent generated by our retail properties. foodland super market, ltd. has ceased all operations in its leased premises and has subleased the premises to international church of the foursquare gospel. although we are currently collecting the rent for the leased premises, foodland super market, ltd.s lease expires in 2014 and it is unlikely that it will renew its lease with us. in the event that foodland super market, ltd. does not renew its lease with us, there can be no assurances that we will be able to re-lease such premises at market rents, or at all, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and cash available for distribution and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. many of the leases at our retail properties contain co-tenancy or go-dark provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations or terminate their leases, any of which could adversely affect our performance or the value of the applicable retail property. many of the leases at our retail properties contain co-tenancy provisions that condition a tenants obligation to remain open, the amount of rent payable by the tenant or the tenants obligation to continue occupancy on certain conditions, including: (1) the presence of a certain anchor tenant or tenants; (2) the continued operation of an anchor tenants store; and (3) minimum occupancy levels at the applicable retail property. if a co-tenancy provision is triggered by a failure of any of these or other applicable conditions, a tenant could have the right to cease operations, to terminate its lease early or to a reduction of its rent. in periods of prolonged economic decline, there is a higher than normal risk that co-tenancy provisions will be triggered as there is a higher risk of tenants closing stores or terminating leases during these periods. in addition to these co-tenancy provisions, certain of the leases at our retail properties contain go-dark provisions that allow the tenant to cease operations while continuing to pay rent. this could result in decreased customer traffic at the applicable retail property, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at that property, which may result in our other tenants being unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. these provisions also may result in lower rental revenue generated under the applicable leases. to the extent co-tenancy or go-dark provisions in our retail leases result in lower revenue or tenant sales or tenants rights to terminate their leases early or to a reduction of their rent, our performance or the value of the applicable retail property could be adversely affected.   11 table of contents we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, thereby increasing or prolonging vacancies, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2012, leases representing 8.9% of the square footage and 9.6% of the annualized base rent of the properties in our office, retail and retail portion of our mixed-use portfolios will expire in 2013, and an additional 4.7% of the square footage of the properties in our office, retail and retail portion of our mixed-use portfolios was available. we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-let at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. in addition, our ability to lease our multifamily properties at favorable rates, or at all, may be adversely affected by the increase in supply and deterioration in the multifamily market stemming from the recent recession, and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. if the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth. our business strategy involves the acquisition of retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use properties. these activities require us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategies. we continue to evaluate the market of available properties and may attempt to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist. however, we may be unable to acquire properties identified as potential acquisition opportunities. our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms, or at all, may be exposed to the following significant risks:        we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete;        even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to conditions to closing, which we may be unable to satisfy; and        we may be unable to finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all. if we are unable to finance property acquisitions or acquire properties on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. in addition, failure to identify or complete acquisitions of suitable properties could slow our growth. we face significant competition for acquisitions of real properties, which may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of these acquisitions. the current market for acquisitions continues to be extremely competitive. this competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties. we also face significant competition for attractive acquisition opportunities from an indeterminate number of investors, including publicly traded and privately held reits, private equity investors and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the geographic proximity of investments and the payment of higher acquisition prices. this competition will increase if   12 table of contents investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment. competition for investments may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and may have the effect of increasing prices paid for such acquisition properties and/or reducing the rents we can charge and, as a result, adversely affecting our operating results. our future acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect, and we may otherwise be unable to operate these properties to meet our financial expectations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. our future acquisitions and our ability to successfully operate the properties we acquire in such acquisitions may be exposed to the following significant risks:        even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price;        we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations;        our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;        we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;        we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected;        market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and        we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities, such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. if we cannot operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. we may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if our revenues do not increase, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time, the need periodically to repair, renovate and re-lease space, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. if our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property. as a result, if revenues decline, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance, loan payments and maintenance, generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. if we are unable to decrease operating costs when demand for our properties decreases and our revenues decline, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.   13 table of contents our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital. if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms than our current debt financings. equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares. we cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the markets perception of our growth potential, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy, including the development and redevelopment of our assets, on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy. high mortgage rates and/or unavailability of mortgage debt may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire, our net income and the amount of cash distributions we can make. if mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance the purchase of properties. if we place mortgage debt on properties, we may be unable to refinance the properties when the loans become due, or to refinance on favorable terms. if interest rates are higher when we refinance our properties, our income could be reduced. if any of these events occur, our cash flow could be reduced. this, in turn, could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money. in addition, to the extent we are unable to refinance the properties when the loans become due, we will have fewer debt guarantee opportunities available to offer under our tax protection agreement. mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt. incurring mortgage and other secured debt obligations increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default. any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of our portfolio of properties. for tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties that is subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements imposed by the code. some of our financing arrangements involve balloon payment obligations, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions. some of our financing arrangements require us to make a lump-sum or balloon payment at maturity. our ability to make a balloon payment at maturity is uncertain and may depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing or our ability to sell the property. at the time the balloon payment is due, we may or may not be able to refinance the existing financing on terms as favorable as the original loan or sell the property at a price sufficient to make the balloon payment. the effect of a refinancing or sale could affect the rate of return to stockholders and the projected time of disposition of our assets. in addition, payments of principal and interest made to service our debts may leave us with insufficient cash to pay the distributions that we are required to pay to maintain our qualification as a reit.   14 table of contents failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit, we may enter into hedging transactions to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt. our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate cap agreements or interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that such arrangements would not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes or that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. in addition, interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. hedging could reduce the overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. in addition, while such agreements would be intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they could also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements would not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements or that the underlying transactions could fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under financial accounting standards board, or fasb, accounting standards codification, or asc, topic 815, derivative and hedging. our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to engage in some business activities, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures and make certain investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:        restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;        restrict our ability to incur additional liens;        restrict our ability to make certain investments (including certain capital expenditures);        restrict our ability to merge with another company;        restrict our ability to sell or dispose of assets;        restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders; and        require us to satisfy minimum financial coverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements and maximum leverage ratios. these limitations restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. in addition, our credit facility contains specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. if we invest in mortgage receivables, including originating mortgages, such investment would be subject to several risks, any of which could decrease the value of such investments and result in a significant loss to us. from time to time, we may invest in mortgage receivables, including originating mortgages. in general, investments in mortgages are subject to several risks, including:        borrowers may fail to make debt service payments or pay the principal when due, which may make it necessary for us to foreclose our mortgages or engage in costly negotiations;        the value of the mortgaged property may be less than the principal amount of the mortgage note securing the property;   15 table of contents      interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost for the funds to acquire these mortgages; and        the mortgages may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens, in which case we would need to make payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it in its entirety to protect such mortgage investment. if any of these risks were to be realized, the total amount we would recover from our mortgage receivables may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss and our mortgage receivables may be materially and adversely affected. adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the u.s. economy or real estate industry as a whole, including the recent dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic downturn. these conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock as a result of the following potential consequences, among others:        decreased demand for retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use space, which would cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;        reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;        our ability to obtain financing on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; and        one or more lenders under our credit facility could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all. in addition, the economic downturn has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the businesses of many of our tenants. as a result, we may see increases in bankruptcies of our tenants and increased defaults by tenants, and we may experience higher vacancy rates and delays in re-leasing vacant space, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. we are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment, such as weakness in the economy, the level of consumer spending, the adverse financial condition of large retailing companies and competition from discount and internet retailers, any of which could adversely affect market rents for retail space and the willingness or ability of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers. a portion of our properties are in the retail real estate market. this means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail sector generally, as well as the market for retail space. the retail environment and the market for retail space have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, internet retailers and other online businesses. increases in consumer spending via the internet may significantly affect our retail tenants ability to generate sales in their stores. in addition, some of our retail tenants face competition from the expanding market for digital content and hardware. new and enhanced technologies, including new digital technologies and new web services technologies, may increase competition for certain of our retail tenants.   16 table of contents any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers. in turn, these conditions could negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders. we have limited operating history as a reit or a publicly traded company and may not be able to successfully operate as a reit or a publicly traded company. we have limited operating history as a reit or a publicly traded company. we cannot assure you that the past experience of our senior management team will be sufficient to successfully operate our company as a reit or a publicly traded company, including the requirements to timely meet disclosure requirements of the sec, and comply with the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. we were required to develop and implement control systems and procedures in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit and satisfy our periodic and current reporting requirements under applicable sec regulations and comply with new york stock exchange, or nyse, listing standards, and this transition could place a significant strain on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. failure to operate successfully as a public company or maintain our qualification as a reit would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. see -risks related to our status as a reit-failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. we face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. we compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire. as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. we may be required to make rent or other concessions and/or significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, causing our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock to be adversely affected. to the extent adverse economic conditions continue in the real estate market and demand for retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use space remains low, we expect that, upon expiration of leases at our properties, we will be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants, accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants. as a result, we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants in sufficient numbers. additionally, we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures. if we are unable to do so or capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to make the required expenditures. this could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases, which could cause an adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. the actual rents we receive for the properties in our portfolio may be less than our asking rents, and we may experience lease roll down from time to time, which could negatively impact our ability to generate cash flow growth. as a result of various factors, including competitive pricing pressure in our submarkets, adverse conditions in the california, oregon, washington, texas and hawaii real estate markets, a general economic downturn and the desirability of our properties compared to other properties in our submarkets, we may be unable to realize the   17 table of contents asking rents across the properties in our portfolio. in addition, the degree of discrepancy between our asking rents and the actual rents we are able to obtain may vary both from property to property and among different leased spaces within a single property. if we are unable to obtain rental rates that are on average comparable to our asking rents across our portfolio, then our ability to generate cash flow growth will be negatively impacted. in addition, depending on asking rental rates at any given time as compared to expiring leases in our portfolio, from time to time rental rates for expiring leases may be higher than starting rental rates for new leases. we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets. in the future we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution. this acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. we are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including competition for guests with other hospitality properties and general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, any of which could adversely affect the revenues generated by our hospitality properties. because we own the waikiki beach walk-embassy suites in hawaii and the santa fe park rv resort in california, we are susceptible to risks associated with the hospitality industry, including:        competition for guests with other hospitality properties, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the managers of our hospitality properties;        increases in operating costs from inflation, labor costs (including the impact of unionization), workers compensation and healthcare related costs, utility costs, insurance and other factors that the managers of our hospitality properties may not be able to offset through higher rates;        the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism, which seasonality may cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues;        general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general;        periodic oversupply resulting from excessive new development;        unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel-related health concerns, including pandemics and epidemics, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related accidents and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as earthquakes or wildfires; and        decreased reimbursement revenue from the licensor for traveler reward programs. if our hospitality properties do not generate sufficient revenues, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to you may be adversely affected.   18 table of contents we must rely on third-party management companies to operate the waikiki beach walkembassy suites in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code, and, as a result, we will have less control than if we were operating the hotel directly. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, we have leased the waikiki beach walkembassy suites to wbw hotel lessee, llc, our taxable reit subsidiary, or trs, lessee, and engaged a third party management company to operate our hotel. while we have some input into operating decisions for the hotel leased by our trs lessee and operated under a management agreement, we will have less control than if we managed the hotel ourselves. even if we believe that our hotel is not being operated efficiently, we may not have sufficient rights under the management agreement to enable us to force the management company to change its method of operation. we cannot assure you that the management company will successfully manage our hotel. a failure by the management company to successfully manage the hotel could lead to an increase in our operating expenses or a decrease in our revenue, or both, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. if our relationship with the franchisor of the waikiki beach walk-embassy suites was to deteriorate or terminate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. we cannot assure you that disputes between us and the franchisor of the waikiki beach walkembassy suites will not arise. if our relationship with the franchisor were to deteriorate as a result of disputes regarding the franchise agreement under which our hotel operates or for other reasons, the franchisor could, under certain circumstances, terminate our current license with them or decline to provide licenses for hotels that we may acquire in the future. if any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. our franchisor, embassy suites, could cause us to expend additional funds on upgraded operating standards, which may adversely affect our results of operations and reduce cash available for distribution to stockholders. under the terms of our franchise license agreement, our hotel operator must comply with operating standards and terms and conditions imposed by the franchisor of the hotel brand, embassy suites. failure by us, our trs lessees or any hotel management company that we engage to maintain these standards or other terms and conditions could result in the franchise license being canceled or the franchisor requiring us to undertake a costly property improvement program. if the franchise license is terminated due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which we expect could be as high as approximately $5.7 million based on operating performance through december 31, 2012. in addition, our franchisor may impose upgraded or new brand standards, such as substantially upgrading the bedding, enhancing the complimentary breakfast or increasing the value of guest awards under its frequent guest program, which can add substantial expense for the hotel. furthermore, under certain circumstances, the franchisor may require us to make certain capital improvements to maintain the hotel in accordance with system standards, the cost of which can be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations and reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders. embassy suites, our franchisor, has a right of first offer with respect to the waikiki beach walkembassy suites, which may limit our ability to obtain the highest price possible for the hotel. pursuant to the terms of our franchise agreement for the waikiki beach walk-embassy suites, the franchisor has a right of first offer to purchase the hotel if we propose to sell all or a portion of the hotel or any interest therein. in the event that we choose to dispose of the hotel, we would be required to notify the franchisor, prior to offering the hotel to any other potential buyer, of the price and conditions on which we would be willing   19 table of contents to sell the hotel, and the franchisor would have the right, within 30 days of receiving such notice, to make an offer to purchase the hotel. if the franchisor makes an offer to purchase that is equal to or greater than the price and on substantially the same terms set forth in our notice, then we will be obligated to sell the hotel to the franchisor at that price and on those terms. if the franchisor makes an offer to purchase for less than the price stated in our notice or on less favorable terms, then we may reject the franchisors offer. the existence of this right of first offer could adversely impact our ability to obtain the highest possible price for the hotel as, during the term of the franchise agreement, we would not be able to offer the hotel to potential purchasers through a competitive bid process or in a similar manner designed to maximize the value obtained for the property without first offering to sell this property to the franchisor. our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development, such as unanticipated expenses, delays and other contingencies, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. we may engage in development and redevelopment activities with respect to certain of our properties. to the extent that we do so, we will be subject to the following risks associated with such development and redevelopment activities:        unsuccessful development or redevelopment opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;        construction or redevelopment costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or unprofitable;        time required to complete the construction or redevelopment of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;        contractor and subcontractor disputes, strikes, labor disputes or supply disruptions;        failure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels within the projected time frame, if at all;        delays with respect to obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary zoning, occupancy, land use and other governmental permits, and changes in zoning and land use laws;        occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;        our ability to dispose of properties developed or redeveloped with the intent to sell could be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing given the current state of the credit markets; and        the availability and pricing of financing to fund our development activities on favorable terms or at all. these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development or redevelopment activities once undertaken, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed, and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and to implement our growth strategies, or could create a negative perception in the capital markets. our continued success and our ability to manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of key personnel, particularly messrs. rady, chamberlain and barton, who have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. among the reasons that these individuals are important to our success is that each has a national or regional industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants and industry personnel. if we lose their services, our relationships with such personnel could diminish.   20 table of contents many of our other senior executives also have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry, which aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and industry participants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. mr. rady is involved in outside businesses, which may interfere with his ability to devote time and attention to our business and affairs. we rely on our senior management team, including mr. rady, for the day-to-day operations of our business. our employment agreement with mr. rady requires him to devote a substantial portion of his business time and attention to our business. mr. rady continues to serve as chairman of the board of directors and president of american assets, inc. and chairman of the board of directors of insurance company of the west. as such, mr. rady has certain ongoing duties to american assets, inc. and insurance company of the west that could require a portion of his time and attention. although we expect that mr. rady will continue to devote a substantial majority of his business time and attention to us, we cannot accurately predict the amount of time and attention that will be required of mr. rady to perform such ongoing duties. to the extent that mr. rady is required to dedicate time and attention to american assets, inc. and/or insurance company of the west, his ability to devote a substantial majority of his business time and attention to our business and affairs may be limited and could adversely affect our operations. we may be subject to on-going or future litigation, including existing claims relating to the entities that owned our properties prior to the formation transactions and otherwise in the ordinary course of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. we may be subject to on-going litigation, including claims in existence prior to the completion of the formation transactions relating to the entities that previously owned our properties and operated the businesses at our properties and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. upon the completion of our initial public offering, we succeeded, as a result of completing the formation transactions, to certain claims arising in the ordinary course of business for unlawful detainer/eviction against certain tenants, damages for alleged breaches of leases, personal injury for slip-and-fall cases and claims with respect to the access and use of the properties by disabled persons under the ada. some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. we generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of currently asserted claims or of those that may arise in the future. in addition, we may become subject to litigation in connection with the formation transactions in the event that prior investors dispute the valuation of their respective interests, the adequacy of the consideration received by them in the formation transactions or the interpretation of the agreements implementing the formation transactions. resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and/or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors. potential losses from earthquakes in california, oregon, washington and hawaii may not be fully covered by insurance. many of the properties we currently own are located in california, oregon, washington and hawaii, which are areas especially subject to earthquakes. while we will carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes and   21 table of contents will be subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments. in addition, we may reduce or discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any such policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. as a result, in the event of an earthquake, we may be required to incur significant costs, and, to the extent that a loss exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. in addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. we may not be able to rebuild our existing properties to their existing specifications if we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of such properties. in the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications. further, reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. environmental and legal restrictions could also restrict the rebuilding of our properties. for example, if we experienced a substantial or comprehensive loss of torrey reserve campus in san diego, california, reconstruction could be delayed or prevented by the california coastal commission, which regulates land use in the california coastal zone. joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers. we may co-invest in the future with other third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. consequently, with respect to any such arrangement we may enter into in the future, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives, and they may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues. such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. in addition, a sale or transfer by us to a third party of our interests in the joint venture may be subject to consent rights or rights of first refusal, in favor of our joint venture partners, which would in each case restrict our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture. where we are a limited partner or non-managing member in any partnership or limited liability company, if such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a reit or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/ or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers. our joint ventures may be subject to debt and, in the current volatile credit market, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls. increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our residents, lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents at our multifamily apartment communities. our multifamily apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other multifamily apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multifamily homes. competitive housing in a particular area and an increase in the affordability of   22 table of contents owner occupied single and multifamily homes due to, among other things, housing prices, oversupply, mortgage interest rates and tax incentives and government programs to promote home ownership, could adversely affect our ability to retain residents, lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could limit our ability, among other things, to meet our capital and operating needs or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we are required under the code, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. in addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, including any net capital gains. because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, from operating cash flow. consequently, we intend to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all and any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage and likelihood of default. our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:        general market conditions;        the markets perception of our growth potential;        our current debt levels;        our current and expected future earnings;        our cash flow and cash distributions; and        the market price per share of our common stock. recently, the capital markets have been subject to significant disruptions. if we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit. risks related to the real estate industry our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and the real estate industry, including local oversupply, reduction in demand or adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties, which could decrease revenues or increase costs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses, scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements. events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties. these events include many of the risks set forth above under risks related to our business and operations, as well as the following:        local oversupply or reduction in demand for retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use space;        adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties;        vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options, and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;   23 table of contents      increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes and state and local taxes;        a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential residents of our multifamily apartment communities deciding to purchase homes instead of renting;        rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs;        civil unrest, acts of war, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;        decreases in the underlying value of our real estate;        changing submarket demographics; and        changing traffic patterns. in addition, periods of economic downturn or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition. the real estate investments made, and to be made, by us are relatively difficult to sell quickly. as a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. return of capital and realization of gains, if any, from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of the underlying property. we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale, other disposition or refinancing at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. in particular, our ability to dispose of one or more properties within a specific time period is subject to certain limitations imposed by our tax protection agreement, as well as weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, such as the recent economic downturn, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located. in addition, the code imposes restrictions on a reits ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. in particular, the tax laws applicable to reits effectively require that we hold our properties for investment, rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. our property taxes could increase due to property tax rate changes or reassessment, which would adversely impact our cash flows. even if we continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some state and local taxes on our properties. the real property taxes on our properties may increase as property tax rates change or as our properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. all of the properties in our portfolio that are located in california have been or will be reassessed as a result of our initial public offering and the formation transactions. therefore, the amount of property taxes we pay in the future may increase substantially from what we have paid in the past. if the property taxes we pay increase, our cash flow would be adversely impacted, and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected.   24 table of contents as an owner of real estate, we could incur significant costs and liabilities related to environmental matters. under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate, clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. these liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. in addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. in addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property, or adjacent properties, for commercial or industrial purposes. such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. for example, del monte center is currently undergoing remediation of dry cleaning solvent contamination from a former onsite dry cleaner. the prior owner of del monte center entered into a fixed fee environmental services agreement in 1997 pursuant to which the remediation will be completed for approximately $3.5 million, with the remediation costs paid for through an escrow funded by the prior owner. we expect that the funds in this escrow account will cover all remaining costs and expenses of the environmental remediation. however, if the regional water quality control boardcentral coast region were to require further work costing more than the remaining escrowed funds, we could be required to pay such overage although we may have a claim for such costs against the prior owner or our environmental remediation consultant. in addition to the foregoing, we possess phase i environmental site assessments for certain of the properties in our portfolio. however, the assessments are limited in scope (e.g., they do not generally include soil sampling, subsurface investigations or hazardous materials survey) and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. furthermore, we do not have phase i environmental site assessment reports for all of the properties in our portfolio and, as such, may not be aware of all potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities at the properties in our portfolio. as a result, we could potentially incur material liability for these issues, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. as the owner of the buildings on our properties, we could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in our buildings. environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if we do not comply with such laws, we could face fines for such noncompliance. also, we could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in our buildings, and we could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in our buildings. in addition, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. environmental liabilities could affect a tenants ability to make rental payments to us, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have an adverse effect on us.   25 table of contents we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to you or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. if we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs, and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury is alleged to have occurred. we may incur significant costs complying with various federal, state and local laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties. the properties in our portfolio are subject to various covenants and federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting and licensing requirements. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials of community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. among other things, these restrictions may relate to fire and safety, seismic or hazardous material abatement requirements. there can be no assurance that existing laws and regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs. our growth strategy may be affected by our ability to obtain permits, licenses and zoning relief. our failure to obtain such permits, licenses and zoning relief or to comply with applicable laws could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. in addition, federal and state laws and regulations, including laws such as the ada and the fhaa, impose further restrictions on our properties and operations. under the ada and the fhaa, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. some of our properties may currently be in non-compliance with the ada or the fhaa. if one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ada, the fhaa or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance and we might incur governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. in addition, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock.   26 table of contents risks related to our organizational structure ernest s. rady and his affiliates, directly or indirectly, own a substantial beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis and have the ability to exercise significant influence on our company and our operating partnership, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. as of december 31, 2012, mr. rady and his affiliates owned approximately 13.9% of our outstanding common stock and 26.6% of our outstanding common units, which together represent an approximate 35.8% beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis. consequently, mr. rady may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder action, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, including business combinations, consolidations and mergers. in addition, we may not, without prior limited partner approval, directly or indirectly transfer all or any portion of our interest in the operating partnership before the later of the death of mr. rady and the death of his wife, in connection with a merger, consolidation or other combination of our assets with another entity, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a reclassification, recapitalization or change in any outstanding shares of our stock or other outstanding equity interests or an issuance of shares of our stock, in any case that requires approval by our common stockholders. as a result, mr. rady has substantial influence on us and could exercise his influence in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders. conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of units in our operating partnership, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders. conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our operating partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. our directors and officers have duties to our company under maryland law in connection with their management of our company. at the same time, we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, have fiduciary duties and obligations to our operating partnership and its limited partners under maryland law and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership in connection with the management of our operating partnership. our fiduciary duties and obligations as the general partner of our operating partnership may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company. under maryland law, a general partner of a maryland limited partnership has fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its partners and must discharge its duties and exercise its rights as general partner under the partnership agreement or maryland law consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. the partnership agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of our operating partnership or any partner, on the one hand, and the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, on the other hand, we, in our capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership, are under no obligation not to give priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, and that any action or failure to act on our part or on the part of our directors that gives priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders that does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the limited partners of the operating partnership under its partnership agreement does not violate the duty of loyalty that we, in our capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership, owe to the operating partnership and its partners. additionally, the partnership agreement provides that we will not be liable to the operating partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the operating partnership or any limited partner, except for liability for our intentional harm or gross negligence. our operating partnership must indemnify us, our directors and officers, officers of our operating partnership and our designees from and against any and all claims that relate to the operations of our operating partnership, unless (1) an act or omission of the person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) the person actually received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of the partnership agreement or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the indemnified person had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. our   27 table of contents operating partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation of the persons good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that the person did not meet the standard of conduct for indemnification. our operating partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action initiated by the person seeking indemnification without our approval (except for any proceeding brought to enforce such persons right to indemnification under the partnership agreement) or if the person is found to be liable to our operating partnership on any portion of any claim in the action. no reported decision of a maryland appellate court has interpreted provisions similar to the provisions of the partnership agreement of our operating partnership that modify and reduce our fiduciary duties or obligations as the general partner or reduce or eliminate our liability for money damages to the operating partnership and its partners, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability of the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to modify or reduce the fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the partnership agreement. we assumed unknown liabilities in connection with the formation transactions, and any recourse against third parties, including the prior investors in our assets, for certain of these liabilities will be limited. as part of the formation transactions, we acquired entities and assets that were subject to existing liabilities, some of which may be unknown or unquantifiable. these liabilities might include liabilities for cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessor entities (that had not been asserted or threatened prior to our initial public offering), tax liabilities and accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business. while in some instances we may have the right to seek reimbursement against an insurer, any recourse against third parties, including the prior investors in our assets, for certain of these liabilities will be limited. there can be no assurance that we will be entitled to any such reimbursement or that ultimately we will be able to recover in respect of such rights for any of these historical liabilities. our charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. our charter contains certain ownership limits with respect to our stock. our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take such actions as it determines are advisable to preserve our qualification as a reit. our charter also prohibits the actual, beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 7.275% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 7.275% in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, excluding any shares that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. our board of directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may exempt a person, prospectively or retroactively, from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. our board of directors has granted to each of (1) mr. rady (and certain of his affiliates), (2) cohen & steers management, inc. and (3) rreef america l.l.c. an exemption from the ownership limits that will allow them to own, in the aggregate, up to 19.9%, 15% and 10%, respectively, in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock, subject to various conditions and limitations. the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may:        discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests; or        result in the transfer of shares acquired in excess of the restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and, as a result, the forfeiture by the acquirer of the benefits of owning the additional shares.   28 table of contents we could increase the number of authorized shares of stock, classify and reclassify unissued stock and issue stock without stockholder approval. our board of directors, without stockholder approval, has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock and set the terms of such newly classified or reclassified shares. as a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to, or otherwise conflict with, the rights of holders of our common stock. although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law, or mgcl, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:        business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose fair price and/or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and        control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares) have no voting rights with respect to their control shares, except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. as permitted by the mgcl, our board of directors has, by board resolution, elected to opt out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl. however, we cannot assure you that our board of directors will not opt to be subject to such business combination provisions of the mgcl in the future. certain provisions of the mgcl permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions, some of which (for example, a classified board) are not currently applicable to us. these provisions may have the effect of limiting or precluding a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. our charter contains a provision whereby we elected to be subject to the provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors.   29 table of contents certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us. provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay, or make more difficult, unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. these provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. these provisions include, among others:        redemption rights of qualifying parties;        a requirement that we may not be removed as the general partner of our operating partnership without our consent;        transfer restrictions on common units;        our ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the operating partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or our operating partnership without the consent of the limited partners; and        the right of the limited partners to consent to direct or indirect transfers of the general partnership interest, including as a result of a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, in the event that such transfer requires approval by our common stockholders. in particular, we may not, without prior partnership approval, directly or indirectly transfer all or any portion of our interest in our operating partnership, before the later of the death of mr. rady and the death of his wife, in connection with a merger, consolidation or other combination of our assets with another entity, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a reclassification, recapitalization or change in any outstanding shares of our stock or other outstanding equity interests or an issuance of shares of our stock, in any case that requires approval by our common stockholders. the partnership approval requirement is satisfied, with respect to such a transfer, when the sum of (1) the percentage interest of limited partners consenting to the transfer of our interest, plus (2) the product of (a) the percentage of the outstanding common units held by us multiplied by (b) the percentage of the votes that were cast in favor of the event by our common stockholders equals or exceeds the percentage required for our common stockholders to approve the event resulting in the transfer. as of december 31, 2012, the limited partners, including mr. rady and his affiliates and our other executive officers and directors, owned approximately 31.6% of our outstanding common units and approximately 15.8% of our outstanding common stock, which together represent an approximate 42.1% beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis. our charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. tax protection agreements could limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties, even though a sale or disposition may otherwise be in our stockholders best interest. in connection with the formation transactions, we entered into tax protection agreements with certain limited partners of our operating partnership, including mr. rady and his affiliates and an affiliate of mr. chamberlain, that provide that if we dispose of any interest with respect to carmel country plaza, carmel mountain plaza, del monte center, loma palisades, lomas santa fe plaza, waikele center or the icw plaza portion of torrey reserve campus, which we collectively refer to as the tax protected properties, in a taxable transaction during the period from the closing of our initial public offering through the seventh anniversary of such closing, we will indemnify such limited partners for their tax liabilities attributable to their share of the built-in gain that existed with respect to such property interest as of the time of our initial public offering and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment; provided that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, such indemnification rights will terminate for any such protected partner that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of more than 50% of his or her common units. notwithstanding the foregoing the operating   30 table of contents partnerships indemnification obligations under the tax protection agreement will terminate upon the later of the death of mr. rady and the death of his wife. the tax protected properties represented 29.0% of our portfolios annualized base rent as of december 31, 2012 and including total revenue for waikiki beach walk-embassy suites for the 12 month period ended december 31, 2012. we have no present intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the properties or interest therein in taxable transactions during the restriction period. if we were to trigger the tax protection provisions under these agreements, we would be required to pay damages in the amount of the taxes owed by these limited partners (plus additional damages in the amount of the taxes incurred as a result of such payment). in addition, although it may otherwise be in our stockholders best interest that we sell one of these properties, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations. our tax protection agreements may require our operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business. our tax protection agreements provide that during the period from the closing of our initial public offering through the seventh anniversary of such closing, our operating partnership will offer certain holders of common units the opportunity to guarantee its debt, and following such period, our operating partnership will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such prior investors with debt guarantee opportunities. we will be required to indemnify such holders for their tax liabilities resulting from our failure to make such opportunities available to them (and any tax liabilities incurred as a result of the indemnity payment). notwithstanding the foregoing the operating partnerships indemnification obligations under the tax protection agreement will terminate upon the later of the death of mr. rady and the death of his wife. subject to certain exceptions and limitations, such holders rights to guarantee opportunities will terminate for any given holder that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of more than 50% of his or her common units. we agreed to these provisions in order to assist certain prior investors in deferring the recognition of taxable gain as a result of and after the formation transactions. these obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business. our board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and we may become more highly leveraged, which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations. our investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by our board of directors. accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. further, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that we may incur. our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. if this policy changed, we could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in our debt service. higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations. in addition, a change in our investment policies, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, real estate market fluctuations and liquidity risk. changes to our policies with regards to the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. as permitted by maryland law, our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:        actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or        a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. as a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist. accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company, your ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited.   31 table of contents we are a holding company with no direct operations and, as such, we will rely on funds received from our operating partnership to pay liabilities, and the interests of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership. we do not have, apart from an interest in our operating partnership, any independent operations. as a result, we rely on distributions from our operating partnership to pay any dividends we might declare on shares of our common stock. we also rely on distributions from our operating partnership to meet our obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from our operating partnership. in addition, because we are a holding company, claims of stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our operating partnerships and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. our operating partnership may issue additional partnership units to third parties without the consent of our stockholders, which would reduce our ownership percentage in our operating partnership and would have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by our operating partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders. we may, in connection with our acquisition of properties or otherwise, issue additional partnership units to third parties. such issuances would reduce our ownership percentage in our operating partnership and affect the amount of distributions made to us by our operating partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders. to the extent that our stockholders do not directly own partnership units, our stockholders will not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of our operating partnership. our operating structure subjects us to the risk of increased hotel operating expenses. our lease with our trs lessee requires our trs lessee to pay us rent based in part on revenues from the waikiki beach walk-embassy suites. our operating risks include decreases in hotel revenues and increases in hotel operating expenses, which would adversely affect our trs lessees ability to pay us rent due under the lease, including but not limited to the increases in:        wage and benefit costs;        repair and maintenance expenses;        energy costs;        property taxes;        insurance costs; and        other operating expenses. increases in these operating expenses can have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. future sales of common stock or common units by our directors and officers, or their pledgees, as a result of margin calls or foreclosures could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could, in the future, result in a loss of control of our company. our directors and officers may pledge shares of common stock or common units owned or controlled by them as collateral for loans or for margin purposes in favor of third parties. depending on the status of the various loan obligations for which the stock or units ultimately serve as collateral and the trading price of our   32 table of contents common stock, our directors and/or officers, and their affiliates, may experience a foreclosure or margin call that could result in the sale of the pledged stock or units, in the open market or otherwise. unlike for our directors and officers, sales by these pledgees may not be subject to the volume limitations of rule 144 of the securities act. a sale of pledged stock or units by pledgees could result in a loss of control of our company, depending upon the number of shares of stock or units sold and the ownership interests of other stockholders. in addition, sale of these shares or units, or the perception of possible future sales, could have a materially adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities. risks related to our status as a reit failure to maintain our qualification as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. we elected to be taxed and to operate in a manner that allowed us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending december 31, 2011. we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service, or irs, that we qualify as a reit. therefore, we cannot be assured that we will qualify as a reit, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you for each of the years involved because:        we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;        we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and        unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. in addition, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit, we will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to maintain our qualification as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code, or the treasury regulations, is greater in the case of a reit that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect our investors, our ability maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. even if we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local income, property and excise taxes on our income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event we sell property as a dealer. in addition, our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to tax as regular corporations in the jurisdictions they operate.   33 table of contents if our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences. we believe that our operating partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, our operating partnership will not be subject to federal income tax on its income. instead, each of its partners, including us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of our operating partnerships income. we cannot be assured, however, that the irs will not challenge the status of our operating partnership or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating our operating partnership or any such other subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a reit. also, the failure of our operating partnership or any subsidiary partnerships to qualify as a partnership could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. our ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries will be limited, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not conducted on arms length terms. we own an interest in one taxable reit subsidiary, our trs lessee, and may acquire securities in additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future. a taxable reit subsidiary is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary. if a taxable reit subsidiary owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary. other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a taxable reit subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent reit. a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation. in addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a taxable reit subsidiary and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arms length basis. a reits ownership of securities of a taxable reit subsidiary is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to reits. not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test. we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our taxable reit subsidiaries and other nonqualifying assets will be less than 25% of the value of our total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. in addition, we intend to structure our transactions with our taxable reit subsidiaries to ensure that they are entered into on arms length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 25% limitation or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions, and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. to maintain our reit status, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. in order to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income   34 table of contents and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from, among other things, differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. these sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the markets perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the market price of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. we may in the future choose to make dividends payable partly in our common stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive. to maintain our reit status, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains. in order to preserve cash to repay debt or for other reasons, we may satisfy the reit distribution requirements by distributing taxable dividends that are payable partly in our stock and partly in cash. taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. as a result, a u.s. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales may have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of our common stock. dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. the maximum tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. dividends payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for the 20% rate. although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including the per share trading price of our common stock. the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.   35 table of contents complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments. to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions. we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. as a result, having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to: (1) sell assets in adverse market conditions; (2) borrow on unfavorable terms; or (3) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. accordingly, satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results, profitability and ability to execute our business plan. moreover, if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset, income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100% tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us, including our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. department of the treasury. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.   item 1b. unresolved
