item 1a.    risk factors         investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of, but are not limited to, these risks. in assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. if our existing customers do not renew their term license, perpetual maintenance or other recurring contracts, our business will suffer.         total recurring revenues, which we define as term license, perpetual maintenance, and other recurring revenues, represented 86%, 86% and 80% of total net revenues during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from our clients' renewal of term license, perpetual maintenance and other recurring contracts and such renewals are critical to our future success. some factors that may affect the renewal rate of our contracts include:  the impact of the economic environment and market volatility on our clients and prospects;  the impact of customers consolidating or going out of business;  the price, performance and functionality of our solutions;  the availability, price, performance and functionality of competing products and services;  the effectiveness of our maintenance and support services; and  our ability to develop complementary products and services.         most of our perpetual license customers have historically renewed their annual maintenance although our customers have no obligation to renew such maintenance after the first year of their license agreements. in addition, our customers may select maintenance levels less advantageous to us upon renewal, which may reduce recurring revenue from these customers. market downturns, such as the downturn beginning in the fall of 2008, caused, and may in the future cause, some clients not to renew their maintenance or reduce their level of maintenance, which affects our renewal rates and revenue. our renewal rates are based on cash collections and are disclosed one quarter in arrears. our reported renewal rates may fluctuate. for example, our renewal rates for our quarterly periods of 2009 and first three quarters of 2010 were below the levels we disclosed for our corresponding quarterly periods of 2008, while the rates for the first three quarters of 2010 exceeded the previous corresponding 2009 periods. the decreases in renewal rates reflect reduced maintenance expenditures, 16 table of contents customer attrition, and reductions in products licensed or number of users by clients, as well as from slower payments received from renewal clients.         since we commenced renewing term license contracts in the third quarter of 2007, we have limited experience with renewals of our term license contracts. these were the first three-year term license contracts to be renewed by advent since our transition to a term pricing model began. our customers have no obligation to renew their term license contracts and given the smaller number of term license contracts subject to renewal that were renewed in the second half of 2007 through the first three quarters of 2010, we cannot yet conclude whether customers will renew at a rate consistent with our perpetual maintenance customers. additionally, we cannot predict whether the renewals will be less advantageous to us than the original term contract. for example, the renewal periods for our term license contracts are typically shorter than our original term license contract and customers may request a reduction in the number of users or products licensed, resulting in a lower annual term license fee. further, customers may elect to not renew their term license contracts at all. we may incur significantly more costs in securing our term license contract renewals than we incur for our perpetual maintenance renewals. if our term license contract customers renew under terms less favorable to us or choose not to renew their contracts, or if it costs significantly more to secure a renewal for us, our operating results may be harmed. our sales cycle is long and we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales and the timing of specific implementations.         the purchase of our software products often requires prospective customers to provide significant executive-level sponsorship and to make major systems architecture decisions. as a result, we must generally engage in relatively lengthy sales and contracting efforts. sales transactions may therefore be delayed during the customer decision process because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefit of our products. our business and prospects are subject to uncertainties in the financial markets that can cause customers to remain cautious about capital and information technology expenditures, particularly in uncertain economic environments, or to decrease their information technology budgets as an expense reduction measure. the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our solutions is typically between two and twelve months depending upon the size of the client, and is subject to a number of significant risks that have impacted our sales and over which we have little or no control, including broader financial market volatility, adverse economic conditions, customers' budgeting constraints, internal selection procedures, and changes in customer personnel, among others.         as a result of a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle, we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific perpetual license sales, or term license and advent ondemand sales which we report quarterly as annual contract value (acv). the timing of large individual license sales is especially difficult to forecast, and we may not be successful in closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all. customers may postpone their purchases of our existing products or product enhancements in advance of the anticipated introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors. accordingly, our level of acv bookings and perpetual license revenue in any particular period is subject to significant fluctuation. for example, during fiscal 2009, our acv bookings and perpetual license revenue decreased by 9% and 33%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2008. during 2010, our acv bookings and perpetual license revenue increased by 25% and 5%, respectively, compared to 2009.         when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services, we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are substantially complete. the timing of large implementations is difficult to forecast. customers may delay or postpone the timing of their particular projects due to the availability of resources or other customer specific priorities. if we are not able to complete an implementation project for a term license in a quarter, it will cause us to defer all of the proportionate contract revenues to a subsequent quarter. because our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term, any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in a significant variation in our operating results from quarter to quarter. 17 table of contents our current operating results may not be reflective of our future financial performance.         during 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized 86%, 86% and 80%, respectively, of total net revenues from recurring sources. we generally recognize revenue from these sources ratably over the terms of these agreements, which typically range from one to three years. as a result, almost all of our revenues in any quarter are generated from contracts entered into during previous periods.         consequently, a significant decline in new business generated in any quarter may not materially affect our results of operations in that quarter but will have an impact on our revenue growth rate in future quarters. additionally, a decline in renewals of term agreements, maintenance or data and other subscription contracts during a quarter will not be fully reflected in our financial performance in that quarter. for example, because we recognize revenue ratably, the non-renewal of term agreements or maintenance contracts late in a quarter may have very little impact on revenue for that quarter, but will reduce revenue in future quarters. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs in response to reduced revenue.         further, because of the large percentage of revenue from recurring sources in our term license business model, our historical operating results on a generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) basis will not necessarily be the sole or most relevant factor in predicting our future operating results. accordingly, we report certain non-gaap or operational information, including our quarterly bookings metrics (expressed as acv) and maintenance renewal rates, that is intended to provide investors with certain of the information that management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting of future periods. however, we believe that undue reliance should not be placed upon non-gaap or operating information because this information is neither standardized across companies nor subjected to the same control activities and audit procedures that produce our gaap financial results. uncertain economic and financial market conditions adversely affect our business.         the market for investment management software systems has been and may in the future be negatively affected by a number of factors, including reductions in capital expenditures by customers and volatile performance of major financial markets. for example, the market downturn and fluctuations arising in fall 2008, dissolution and acquisitions of our clients and prospects, the decline in assets under administration (aua) or assets under management (aum) as a result of significant declines in asset values of our clients and the accompanying market uncertainty affected both our ability to sell our solutions and the amount of revenue we received from such sales. we experienced some clients and prospects delaying or cancelling additional license purchases and others went out of business, reduced personnel, or were acquired, which we expect to experience should the financial markets face future hardship. the target clients for our products include a range of financial services organizations that manage investment portfolios. the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets. the demand for our solutions has been and continues to be disproportionately affected by fluctuations, disruptions, instability and downturns in the economy and financial services industry, which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products.         in addition, the failure of existing investment firms or the slowdown in the formation of new investment firms could cause a decline in demand for our solutions. consolidation of financial services firms and other clients will result in reduced technology expenditures or acquired customers using the acquirer's own proprietary software and services solutions or the solutions of another vendor. in some circumstances where both acquisition parties are customers of advent, the combined entity may require fewer advent products and services than each individually licensed, thus reducing our revenue. challenging economic conditions may also cause our customers to experience difficulty with gaining timely access to sufficient credit or our customers may become unable to pay for the products or 18 table of contents services they have purchased, which could result in their inability to fulfill or make timely payments to us. if that were to occur, our ability to collect receivables would be negatively affected, and our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.         we have in the past experienced a number of market downturns in the financial services industry and resulting declines in information technology spending, which has caused longer sales and contracting cycles, deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software and related services. the severity of the market downturn and volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the financial services sector in the last several years makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations in the longer term.         the market downturn beginning in fall 2008 caused, and other downturns in the future may cause clients not to renew their term licenses or perpetual license maintenance. also, significant declines in market value of our clients affect their assets under administration (aua) or assets under management (aum). consequently, we may also experience a decline in the acv of bookings since the pricing of some of our products is based upon our client's aua or aum. furthermore, we have some contracts for which clients pay us fees based on the greater of a negotiated annual minimum fee or a calculated fee that is determined by the client's aua or aum. if a client previously paid us based on the calculated fee, rather than the annual minimum fee, we would experience a decline in revenue as a result of any decline in those clients' aua or aum. we operate in a highly competitive industry.         the market for investment management software is competitive and highly fragmented, is subject to rapid change and is sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants. our largest single source of competition is from proprietary systems used by existing and potential clients, many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by third party vendors such as advent. we also face significant competition from other providers of software and related services as well as providers of outsourced services. many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. in addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets. competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms supported. in recent years, many of our competitors have merged with each other or with other larger third parties, and it is possible that even larger companies will emerge through additional acquisitions of companies and technologies. consolidation among our competitors may result in stronger competitors in our markets and may therefore either result in a loss of market share or harm our results of operations. in addition, we also face competition from potential new entrants into our markets that may develop innovative technologies or business models. furthermore, competitors may respond to weak market conditions by lowering prices, offering better contractual terms and attempting to lure away our customers and prospects with lower cost solutions. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins or loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business. we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements.         the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer demands, evolving industry standards and new regulatory requirements. new products based on recent technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. as a result, our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to their changing standards and practices. we continue to release numerous products and product upgrades and we believe our future success depends on continuing such releases. additionally, in october 2008, we 19 table of contents acquired tamale software which enables us to offer a new product in the nascent research management field and in march 2010, advent norway as acquired goya as to allow us to provide transfer agency-related solutions to mutual fund managers and mutual fund distributors. however, it is too early to know whether these products will meet anticipated sales or will be broadly accepted in the market, that a market will develop as expected for these new products or that we will continue to introduce more products.         we may not be successful in developing, introducing, marketing and licensing our new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements or delays in client implementations or migrations may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues. additionally, existing clients may be reluctant to go through the process of migrating from our axys product to our apx product, which may slow the migration of our customer base to apx. in addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements. our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is also dependent upon the products of other software vendors, including certain system software vendors, such as microsoft corporation, database vendors and development tool vendors. if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws, are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction, are unavailable on acceptable terms, or the vendors exit the business, our business could be seriously harmed. we depend heavily on our axys®, geneva®, apx and moxy® products.         we derive a majority of our net revenues from the license and maintenance revenues from our axys, geneva, apx and moxy products. in addition, moxy and many of our applications, such as partner and various data services, have been designed to provide an integrated solution with axys, geneva and apx. as a result, we believe that for the foreseeable future a majority of our net revenues will depend upon continued market acceptance of axys, geneva, apx, and moxy, and upgrades to those products. this is particularly true as a result of our divestiture of our microedge grants management products, which further concentrates our revenue streams. our operating results may fluctuate significantly.         revenues from recurring sources have grown from 80% in 2008, to 86% in both 2009 and 2010, respectively. during 2010 and 2009, term license revenues comprised approximately 44% of term license, maintenance and other recurring revenues as compared to approximately 35% in fiscal 2008. term license contracts are comprised of both software licenses and maintenance services. individual perpetual software licenses vary significantly in value, and the value and timing of these transactions can therefore cause our quarterly perpetual license revenues to fluctuate. as we continue to sign term license agreements for new customers, grow our subscription, data management and outsourced services revenues, and our customers renew their perpetual maintenance, we expect our revenue from recurring sources to continue to increase slightly as a percent of net revenues.         when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services, we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are substantially completed and then we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining length of the contract. if the implementation services are still in progress as of quarter-end, we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter. at the point professional services are substantially completed, we recognize a pro-rata amount of the term license revenue, professional services fees earned and related expenses, based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services. during 2009, the revenue recognized from completed implementations exceeded the revenue deferred from projects being implemented, resulting in a net recognition of revenue of $6.1 million for fiscal 2009, composed of $3.5 million of term license revenue and $2.6 million of 20 table of contents professional services revenue. subsequently in 2010, we returned to our prior trend of net term license revenue deferral. in future periods, our revenues related to completed implementations may vary depending on the number of projects that reach substantial completion during the quarter. term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length. the term license component of the deferred revenue balance will increase or decrease in the future depending on the amount of new term license bookings relative to the number of implementations that reach substantial completion in a particular quarter. although our substantial revenue from recurring sources under our term license model provides us with longer term stability and more visibility in the short term, our quarterly net revenues and operating results may still fluctuate significantly depending on these and other factors. our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short-term. due to the fixed nature of these expenses, combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved on our products, an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter may adversely affect our operating results.         in addition, we experience seasonality in our licensing. we believe that this seasonality results primarily from customer budgeting cycles and expect this seasonality to continue in the future. the fourth quarter of the year typically has more licensing activity. that can result in term license bookings and perpetual license fee revenue being the highest in the fourth quarter, followed by lower term license bookings and perpetual license revenue in the first quarter of the following year. this seasonality has been, and may be in the future, adversely affected by market downturns and uncertain economic conditions. also, term licenses entered into during a quarter may not result in recognition of associated revenue until later quarters, as we begin recognizing revenue for such licenses when the related implementation services are substantially complete. in addition, we may incur commission and bonus expenses in the period in which we enter into a license, but not recognize the associated revenue until later periods.         because of the above factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily reliable indicators of future performance. our stock price may fluctuate significantly.         like many other companies, our stock price has been subject to wide fluctuations in recent quarters as a result of market volatility. if net revenues or earnings in any quarter or our financial guidance for future periods fail to meet the investment community's expectations, our stock price is likely to decline. even if our revenues or earnings meet or exceed expectations, our stock price is subject to decline in periods of high market volatility because our stock price is affected by trends in the financial services sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our performance. unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions, which can be caused by many factors, including declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitation on the availability or increases in the cost of credit or capital; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic commodities; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability; natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors, have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business, profitability and stock price. if our relationship with financial times/interactive data is terminated, our business may be harmed.         many of our clients use our proprietary interface to retrieve pricing and other data electronically from financial times/interactive data ("ftid"). ftid pays us a commission which we classify as other recurring revenues. the commission is based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients. our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and our software would need to be redesigned to operate with additional alternative data vendors if ftid's 21 table of contents services were unavailable for any reason. non-renewal of our current agreement with ftid would require at least two years' prior notice by either us or them and the agreement may be terminated upon 90 days' advance notice for an uncured material breach of the other party. while we have contracts with other data vendors for substantially similar financial data with which our products can be used, if our relationship with ftid was terminated or their services were unavailable to clients for any reason, we cannot be certain that we could enter into contracts with additional alternative data providers, or that other relationships would provide similar commission rates to us or if the amount of data used by our clients would remain the same, and our operating results could suffer or our resources could be constrained from the costs of redesigning our software. if our large subscription-based clients or if our revenue sharing relationships are terminated, our business may be harmed.         in recent years, advent has periodically entered into contracts relating to our subscription, data management revenue streams and outsourced services with contract values that are substantially larger than we have customarily entered into in the past, including our agreement with tiaa-cref. we do not know whether we will be able to continue to sign large recurring revenue contracts of this nature or if such clients will renew their contracts at similar rates, if at all. some of these agreements are subject to milestones, acceptance and penalties and there is no assurance that these agreements will be fully implemented. in addition, we have revenue sharing agreements with other companies that provide revenue to advent for our clients' use of those companies' services and products. our operating results could be adversely impacted if these agreements are not fully implemented, terminated or not renewed, or if we are unable to continue to generate similar opportunities and enter similar or larger sized contracts in the future. our outsourcing and data integration services are subject to risks that may harm our business.         our clients rely on our outsourcing and data services to meet their operational needs, including account aggregation and reconciliation. because our services are complex, because we utilize third party data and other vendors, and because our clients use our services in a variety of ways, our services may have undetected errors or defects, service disruptions, delays, or incomplete or incorrect data that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers, failure to meet service levels and service disruptions. in addition, our security measures could be breached or unauthorized access to our information or our customers' information could occur. such potential errors, defects, delays, disruptions or other performance problems may damage our clients' business, harm our reputation, result in losing future sales, cause clients to withhold payment or terminate or not renew their agreements with us, and subject us to litigation and other possible liabilities. we must recruit and retain key employees.         we believe that our future success is dependent on the continued employment of our senior management and our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. members of our executive management team have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to advent. we need technical resources such as our product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products; we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships; we must recruit professional service consultants to support our implementations; we must hire client services personnel to provide technical support to our growing installed base of customers; and we must attract and retain financial and accounting personnel to comply with our public company reporting requirements. we need to identify, attract, motivate and retain such employees with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. however, experienced high quality personnel in the information technology industry 22 table of contents continue to be in high demand and competition for their talents remains intense, especially in the san francisco bay area where the majority of our employees are located.         we have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining such highly skilled personnel. in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industries and san francisco bay area, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment and market downturns may result in our equity incentives becoming less valuable. additionally, accounting regulations requiring the expensing of equity compensation impair our ability to provide these incentives without reporting significant compensation costs.         we may also choose to create additional performance and retention incentives in order to retain our employees, including the granting of additional stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares or performance units to employees or issuing incentive cash bonuses. such incentives may either dilute our existing stockholder base or result in unforeseen operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, could result in our stock price falling or may not be valued as highly by our employees which may create retention issues. we face challenges in expanding our international operations.         we market and sell our products in the united states and, to a growing extent, internationally. from 2001 through 2005, we acquired the subsidiaries of our independent distributor. in addition, we have begun to expand our sales in relatively new jurisdictions for us, such as the middle east, eastern europe, and asia. in 2006, we opened a branch office of advent europe ltd. in the united arab emirates, and we established advent software (asia) ltd., a subsidiary of advent software, inc., in hong kong in 2008. in addition, we established a subsidiary of advent software (asia), ltd. in beijing, china and established advent software singapore pte. ltd., a subsidiary of advent software, inc. in april 2010. in march 2010, our wholly-owned norwegian subsidiary, advent norway as, acquired the entire share capital of goya as, a norwegian software company that provides transfer agency-related solutions to mutual fund managers and mutual fund distributors. in addition, in february 2011, advent software, inc. acquired syncova solutions, ltd., a united kingdom-based company that provides margin management and debt finance reconciliation and optimization software.         we cannot be certain that establishing businesses in other countries will produce the desired levels of revenues, such as in the case of our former greek subsidiary, advent hellas, which produced less than satisfactory revenues and profitability before its sale by advent in 2005. also, worldwide volatility in financial markets may disrupt our sales efforts in overseas markets. we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally. in other instances, we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets. for example, we previously outsourced certain engineering activities to a business partner located in china until we transitioned those contract developers to become employees of our beijing office. in addition, international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including:  the impact of recessions and market fluctuations in economies outside the united states;  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;  difficulty of enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;  unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;  us and foreign trade-protection measures and export and import requirements; 23 table of contents  difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language, regulatory and technology standards of other countries;  resistance of local cultures to foreign-based companies and difficulties establishing local partnerships or engaging local resources;  difficulties in and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and  political and economic instability.         the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local foreign currencies. future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect revenues and accounts receivable from international sales and the us dollar value of our foreign subsidiaries' revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. our international service revenues and certain license revenues from our european subsidiaries are generally denominated in local foreign currencies. difficulties in integrating our acquisitions and expanding into new business areas have impacted and could continue to impact our business adversely and we face risks associated with potential acquisitions, investments, divestitures and expansion.         periodically we seek to grow through the acquisition of additional complementary businesses. in october 2008, we completed the acquisition of tamale software, inc., which provides research management software. more recently in march 2010, our wholly-owned norwegian subsidiary, advent norway as, acquired the entire share capital of goya as, a norwegian software company that provides transfer agency-related solutions to mutual fund managers and mutual fund distributors. in addition, in february 2011, advent software, inc. acquired syncova solutions, ltd., a united kingdom-based company that provides margin management and debt finance reconciliation and optimization software.         the process of integrating our acquisitions has required and will continue to require significant resources, particularly in light of our relative inexperience in integrating acquisitions, potential regulatory requirements and operational demands. in particular, our tamale acquisition reflects our entry into the research management software market, where we have no prior experience. integrating these acquisitions in the past has been time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to our business. this integration process has strained our managerial resources, resulting in the diversion of these resources from our core business objectives, and may do so in the future. failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or to integrate the operations of these entities successfully has harmed and could potentially harm our business, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. the assumptions we made in determining the value and relative risks of these acquisitions could be erroneous. for example, in the first quarter of 2003, we closed our australian subsidiary because it failed to perform at a satisfactory profit level and similarly in the fourth quarter of 2005, we disposed of our advent hellas subsidiary in greece because of less than satisfactory profitability. in addition, as we have expanded into new business areas and built new offerings through strategic alliances and internal development, as well as acquisitions, some of this expansion has required significant management time and resources without generating required revenues. we have had difficulty and may continue to have difficulty creating demand for such offerings. furthermore, we may face other unanticipated costs from our acquisitions, such as disputes involving earn-out and incentive compensation amounts.         we may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies in the future. in addition, we periodically evaluate the performance of all our products and services and may sell or discontinue current products, product lines or services, particularly as we focus on ways to 24 table of contents streamline our operations. for example, in october 2009, we divested our microedge subsidiary. failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or divestiture could harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, we may have to incur debt, write-off investments, infrastructure costs or other assets, incur severance liabilities, write-off impaired goodwill or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. financing may not be available to us on sufficiently advantageous terms, or at all, and we have let our credit facility with wells fargo foothill lapse. the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders' ownership. finally, we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for future acquisitions. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased competition that could seriously harm our business.         our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. we have registered trademarks and copyrights for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, resellers, vendors and others. we seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. we also have three issued patents. despite our efforts, existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection. it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. in addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with our products, or others may not design around any patent that we have or that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. we cannot be sure that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any patent, if issued, would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and so our expansion into international markets may expose our proprietary rights to increased risks. litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology which may be time-consuming and expensive, with no assurance of success. as a result, we cannot be sure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may incur additional costs or be prevented from selling our products and services.         we cannot be certain that our products or services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. as a result, we may be subject to litigation and claims, including claims of misappropriation of trade secrets or infringement of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties that would be time-consuming and costly to resolve and may lead to unfavorable judgments or settlements. if we discovered that our products or services violated the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may have to make substantial changes to our products or services or obtain licenses from such third parties. we might not be able to obtain such licenses on favorable terms or at all, and we may be unable to change our products successfully or in a timely or cost-effective manner. failure to resolve an infringement matter successfully or in a timely manner would damage our reputation and force us to incur significant costs, including payment of damages, redevelopment costs, diversion of 25 table of contents management's attention and satisfaction of indemnification obligations that we have with our clients, as well as prevent us from selling certain products or services. our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.         our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of december 31, 2010 consisted of us government and commercial debt securities. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.         as a result of adverse financial market conditions, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from recent market liquidity and credit concerns. as of december 31, 2010, we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions. although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. in addition, the decrease in interest rates has materially decreased the interest income we receive on our investments. catastrophic events could adversely affect our business.         we are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the san francisco bay area, which is a region of seismic activity. we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and certain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. further, such disruptions could cause further instability in the financial markets or the spending of our clients and prospects upon which we depend.         in addition to the recent severe market conditions, other catastrophic events such as abrupt political change, terrorist acts, conflicts or wars may cause damage or disruption to the economy, financial markets and our customers. the potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts, wars or political unrest, which has occurred recently in the middle east, egypt, libya and tunisia, have created many economic and political uncertainties. although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could unsettle the financial markets or result in a decline in information technology spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. undetected errors or failures found in new products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.         our products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point in their lives, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. for example, during 2010, we released new versions of axys, geneva, apx and tamale rms. despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products and services until after 26 table of contents commencement of commercial shipments or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins, any of which could seriously harm our business. additionally, our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly as we expand into new international markets. two of our principal stockholders have an influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which you disagree and which may adversely affect the value of your investment.         our chief executive officer and the chairman of our board of directors own or control, indirectly or directly, a substantial number of shares of our common stock (approximately 6% and 30%, respectively, as of february 28, 2011). as a result, if these parties were to act together, they would have the ability to exert significant influence on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, such as the election or removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation or the approval of a business combination. these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders or it may be difficult to approve these actions without their consent. this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. changes in securities laws and regulations may increase our costs or may harm demand.         most of our customers operate within a highly regulated environment. in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy, congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. the information provided by, or resident in, the software or services we provide to our customers could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving our customers, which could result in requests for information from us that could be expensive and time consuming for us. in addition, clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation, bankruptcy, receivership, reductions in assets under management or assets under administration, or diminished operations that would adversely affect our revenues and collection of receivables.         our customers must comply with governmental, self-regulatory organization and other rules, regulations, directives and standards. new legislation or changes in such rules, regulations, directives or standards may reduce demand for our services or increase our expenses. we develop, configure and market products and services to assist customers in meeting these requirements. new legislation, or a significant change in rules, regulations, directives or standards, could cause our services to become obsolete, reduce demand for our services or increase our expenses in order to continue providing services to clients.         the recently enacted dodd-frank wall street reform and protection act of 2010 ("dodd-frank act") represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states, establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection (the "bcfp"), and will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules. while the general framework of the reforms is set forth in the dodd-frank act, it provides for numerous studies and reports and the adoption and implementation of rules and regulations by regulatory agencies over the next four years to clarify and implement the act's requirements fully.         we believe that it is too early to know the precise long-term impact on our business of the increased regulation of financial institutions. while it could lead to increased demand for advent's products and services, demand could be negatively impacted by the deferral of purchase decisions by our customers until the new regulations have been adopted and the full impact and expense of the new 27 table of contents regulatory environment is more clearly understood. the dodd-frank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. accordingly, it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the dodd-frank act and the forthcoming implementing rules and regulations will have on our business and the financial services industry.         additionally, as a publicly-traded company, we are subject to significant regulations including the dodd-frank act and the sarbanes-oxley act ("the sarbanes-oxley act") of 2002. there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the dodd-frank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. our efforts to comply with these requirements could result in an increase of our operating and compliance costs.         the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and/or compliance practices. as part of the act's requirements, the sec enacted new rules on a variety of subjects, and the nasdaq stock market enacted new corporate governance listing requirements. these developments have increased and may in the future increase our accounting and legal compliance costs and could also expose us to additional liability if we fail to comply with these or other new rules and reporting requirements. in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred approximately $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in sarbanes-oxley related expenses consisting of external consulting costs. in addition, such developments may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, or as executive officers, more difficult. changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges.         we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these principles are subject to interpretation by us, the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting principles. a change in these principles or a change in the interpretations of these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. some of our accounting principles that have been or may be affected include:  software revenue recognition;  accounting for stock-based compensation;  accounting for income taxes; and  accounting for business combinations and related goodwill. changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.         we are a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.         in addition, we could be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these examinations would be expected to focus on areas where considerable judgment is exercised by the company. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from an examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from an examination. we believe 28 table of contents such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. security risks may harm our business.         maintaining the security of computers, computer networks, hosted solutions and the transmission of confidential information over public networks is essential to commerce and communications, particularly in the market in which advent operates. efforts of others to seek unauthorized access to advent's or its clients' information, computers and networks or introduce viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that disable or impair computers into our systems or those of our customers or other third parties, could disrupt or make our systems and services inaccessible or allow access to proprietary information and data of advent or its clients. advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments, could also result in compromises or breaches of our security systems. our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, exposing us to a risk of data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, business interruption, litigation and other possible liabilities, as well as possibly requiring us to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. potential changes in securities laws and regulations governing the investment industry's use of soft dollars may reduce our revenues.         some of our clients utilized trading commissions ("soft dollar arrangements") to pay for software products and services. during each of fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total value of advent products and services paid with soft dollars was approximately 3% of our total billings. such soft dollar arrangements could be impacted by changes in the regulations governing those arrangements.         in july 2006, the sec published an interpretive release that provides guidance on money managers' use of client commissions to pay for brokerage and research services under the safe harbor set forth in section 28(e) of the securities exchange act of 1934. the interpretive release clarifies that money managers may use client commissions ("soft dollars") to pay only for eligible brokerage and research services. among other matters, the interpretive release states that eligible brokerage includes those products and services that relate to the execution of the trade from the point at which the money manager communicates with the broker-dealer for the purpose of transmitting an order for execution, through the point at which funds or securities are delivered or credited to the advised account. in addition, for potentially "mixed-use" items (such as trade order management systems) that are partly eligible and partly ineligible, the interpretive release states that money managers must make a reasonable allocation of client commissions in accordance with the eligible and ineligible uses of the items. based on this guidance, our customers may change their method of paying all or a portion of certain advent products or services from soft to hard dollars, and as a result reduce their usage of these products or services in order to avoid increasing expenses, which could cause our revenues to decrease. if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or our filings may not be timely. as a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.         effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. if we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal control that need improvement including control deficiencies that may constitute material weaknesses. 29 table of contents         we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.         any failure to implement or maintain improvements in our internal control over financial reporting, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of these improvements in our controls, could cause significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls and consequently cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock. item 1b.    unresolved
