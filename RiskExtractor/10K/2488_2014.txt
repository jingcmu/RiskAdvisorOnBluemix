item 1a. risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously. intel corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. intel corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. intels market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. as a result of intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. oems, that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of intel technology. additionally, intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. we expect intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. for example, intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks. intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated graphics chipsets. intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. intel could also take actions that place our discrete gpus at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics and visual solutions market, such as nvidia corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. as long as intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by intels:        business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;        product mix and introduction schedules;        product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;        exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;   17 table of contents      control over industry standards, pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or bios, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms; and        marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its oem customers. intels dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier oems and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. for example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop pcs and notebooks to tablets, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. historically, a significant portion of our computing solutions revenue has been related to desktop pcs. currently, a significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portions of the market, and we believe that pc market conditions will remain challenging. as consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the pc market, pc sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. if we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. if our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. the process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. moreover, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. if we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.   18 table of contents if we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. the health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moodys or standard & poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. in addition, credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. for example, in the first quarter of 2013, moodys lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to b2 from b1 and standard & poor lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to b from bb. our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. we rely on gf to manufacture most of our microprocessor and apu products. if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted. the wsa governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by gf. pursuant to the wsa, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements from gf with limited exceptions. if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices, or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience delays in product launches, supply shortages for certain products or increased costs, and our business could be materially adversely affected. in addition, if our requirements are less than the fixed number of wafers that we agreed to purchase, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which will adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. we are currently in the process of negotiating a fourth amendment to the wsa, and we expect that our future purchases from gf will continue to be material. if we do not successfully conclude our negotiations, it could have a material adverse impact on our gross margin and our results of operations. in addition, gf has relied on advanced technology investment company (atic) for its funding needs. if atic fails to adequately fund gf on a timely basis, or at all, gfs ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected. we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. we rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. we also rely on third-party providers to assemble, test, mark and pack certain of our products. it is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.   19 table of contents we cannot assure you that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. in addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. we do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. we obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. the manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. they could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturing suppliers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. if we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturing supplier, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturing suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. if our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. we cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships with our customers and reputation and materially adversely affect our business.   20 table of contents we may not be able to successfully implement our long-term business strategy. we are implementing a long-term business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core pc market to the faster growing ultra low-power client, embedded, professional graphics, semi-custom and dense server markets. currently, a significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portions of the market, and we believe that pc market conditions will remain challenging. the goal of our long-term strategy is to derive approximately 50% of our revenue from high growth markets by the end of 2015. in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc and embedded products represented more than 30% of total net revenue. despite our efforts, we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges. however, if demand for these products is below our expectations, or we are not able to improve cost efficiencies of this business model, we may not realize benefits from our long-term business strategy. moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. we cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. in addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. we may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated. global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business. uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. for example, our revenue in the second half of 2012 and in 2013 was adversely affected, in part, by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end-user pc products, which impacted sales. we believe that consumer pc market conditions will remain challenging. in addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. the risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our senior secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (secured revolving line of credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.   21 table of contents we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. our total debt as of december 28, 2013 was $2.1 billion, which reflects the debt discount adjustment on our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2015 (6.00% notes) and our 8.125% senior notes due 2017 (8.125% notes). our substantial indebtedness may:        make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;        limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;        limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;        require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;        place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and        increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. the indentures governing our 8.125% notes, 7.75% senior notes due 2020 (7.75% notes) and 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:        incur additional indebtedness;        pay dividends and make other restricted payments;        make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries;        create or permit certain liens;        create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;        use the proceeds from sales of assets;        enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and        consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. our secured revolving line of credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. in addition, during a domestic cash trigger period (a domestic cash trigger period), which occurs (i) upon an event of default or (ii) when the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in certain accounts is at any time less than $500 million, and ends when both (a) no event of default has existed for 45 days and (b) the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in such accounts has been equal to or greater than $500 million for 45 days, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:        allow certain subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for us or amd international sales & service, ltd. (together, the borrowers) to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount;        create any liens upon any of the borrowers property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our secured revolving line of credit));   22 table of contents      declare or make any distributions;        create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;        make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions;        make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date;        become a party to certain agreements restricting the borrowers ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions; and        modify loan agreements or enter into any non-arms-length transaction with an affiliate. during a domestic cash trigger period, we also would be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio each four-fiscal quarter period ending on and after march 29, 2014. the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. for example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 7.75% notes, 8.125% notes, 7.50% notes and 6.00% notes, as well as under our secured revolving line of credit. the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. if the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.75% notes, 8.125% notes, 7.50% notes or 6.00% notes or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. the markets in which our products are sold are very competitive, and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. we believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality (including enabling state of the art visual experience), power consumption (including battery life), reliability, selling price, speed, size (or form factor), cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), software and hardware compatibility and stability and brand awareness. we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors of products that may provide better performance or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive and aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. with the introduction of our apu products and other competing solutions, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic cards may decrease in the future due to both the improvement of the quality of our competitors integrated graphics and the graphics performance of our apus. if competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. we are implementing a long-term business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core pc market to the faster growing ultra low-power client, embedded, professional graphics, semi-custom and dense server markets. for example, our semi-custom products are developed and customized for our customers particular needs. however, we are entering markets with new and different competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends.   23 table of contents the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. collectively, our top five customers accounted for approximately 54% of our net revenue in 2013. on a segment basis, in 2013, five customers accounted for approximately 58% of the net revenue of our computing solutions segment and five customers accounted for approximately 70% of the net revenue of our graphics and visual solutions segment. we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues of our businesses in the future. if one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom soc products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products. the revenue that we receive from our semi-custom soc products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom soc products to these third parties. as a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline. we also receive royalties paid to us by third parties in connection with sales of their products that incorporate our technology. any revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc products and any royalty revenue is directly related to sales of the third-partys products and reflective of their success in the market. moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. consequently, the semi-custom soc product and royalty revenue expected by us may not be fully realized, and our operating results may be adversely affected. in addition, we expect that as we continue to transition to a semi-custom business model, royalties paid to us by third parties in connection with sales of their products that incorporate our technology will decline. the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. a significant portion of our business is currently dependent upon the market for desktop pcs and notebooks. form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop pcs and notebooks to tablets, with tablets being one of the fastest growing form factors. historically, a significant portion of our computing solutions revenue has been related to desktop pcs. currently, a significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portions of the market, and we believe that pc market conditions will remain challenging. industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. for example, our net revenue in the second half of 2012 and 2013 was adversely affected, in part, by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end-user pc products, which impacted sales. in addition, during the third and fourth quarter of 2013, we ramped sales of our semi-custom soc products. specifically, in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, net revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc and embedded products represented more than 30% of total net revenue. the success of our semi-custom soc products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the sony playstation®4 and microsoft xbox one game console systems. our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. in the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the   24 table of contents capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools available to us. if the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available in the time frame needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, bios software and other computer platform components to support our microprocessor and graphics businesses. we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, bios software and other components that our customers utilize to support our microprocessor, gpu and apu offerings. we also rely on our aibs to support our gpu and apu businesses. in addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors. if the designers, manufacturers, aibs and suppliers of motherboards and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected. if we lose microsoft corporations support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. with respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our apu products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our products. in addition, some software drivers sold with our products are certified by microsoft. if microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. we may incur future impairments of goodwill. we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in managements business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. the occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. if we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. to help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. in addition, our recent and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.   25 table of contents in the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our secured revolving line of credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our secured revolving line of credit. upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.75% notes, 8.125% notes and 7.50% notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date, and to offer to repurchase all of our 6.00% notes then outstanding at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding the repurchase date. in addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit. as of december 28, 2013, $55 million was outstanding under our secured revolving line of credit and $2.0 billion was outstanding under our notes. future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. we may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our secured revolving line of credit. the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. we have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to:        substantial declines in average selling prices;        the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry;        a decline in demand for end-user products (such as pcs) that incorporate our products; and        excess inventory levels. global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. for example, our net revenue in the second half of 2012 and 2013 was adversely affected, in part, by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end-user pc products, which impacted sales. we believe that consumer pc market conditions will remain challenging. the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth, emerging global markets. our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. if demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. in addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. for example, historically, first quarter pc product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. in addition, with respect to our semi-custom soc products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year. many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.   26 table of contents if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. we purchase equipment and materials for our internal back-end manufacturing operations from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. our third-party manufacturing suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. we also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including apu products. similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (pcbs), substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. from time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. if we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. our issuance to west coast hitech l.p. (wch) of warrants to purchase 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, if and when exercised by wch, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and the conversion of the remainder of our 6.00% notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. the warrants issued to wch became exercisable in july 2009. any issuance by us of additional shares to wch upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. any sales in the public market by wch of any shares owned by wch could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrants could depress the price of our common stock. moreover, the conversion of our remaining 6.00% notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. the conversion of our 6.00% notes could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of our 6.00% notes. any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our 6.00% notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the conversion of our 6.00% notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. if our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. we cannot assure you that, despite our testing   27 table of contents procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenues, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. in addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. as a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. a product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. as we continue to grow our business, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. if we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. we rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. in addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. we rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. we are currently pursuing initiatives to transform and optimize our business operations through the reengineering of certain processes,   28 table of contents investment in automation and engagement of strategic partners or resources to assist with certain business functions. these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. these changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. we are currently implementing an initiative to transition certain key information technology applications and business systems from various amd development locations to centralized consolidated data centers. there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, and computer system or network failures. there can be no assurance that our business systems or those of our third-party business partners would not be subject to similar incidents, including cyber-security incidents, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation. in the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. we believe that companies in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. in some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. these incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. we base our inventory levels in part on customers estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. pc and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. in addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include:        a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products;        a production or design defect in our products;   29 table of contents      a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;        a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or        our competitors taking aggressive pricing actions. because market conditions are uncertain and because we believe that consumer pc market conditions will remain challenging, these and other factors could materially adversely affect our business. our reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board (aib) partners subjects us to certain risks. we market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and aib partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. these agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and aibs to offer our competitors products. we are dependent on our distributors and aibs to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. if any significant distributor or aib or a substantial number of our distributors or aibs terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and aib partners or offer the appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. additionally, distributors and aibs typically maintain an inventory of our products. in most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. our agreements with aibs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors and aibs, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors or the aibs. however, in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. acquisitions could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock. our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. in some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. the identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. moreover, if such acquisitions require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions which could harm our operating results. in addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. acquisitions may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business.   30 table of contents our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we maintain operations around the world, including in the united states, canada, europe and asia. we rely on third-party wafer foundries in europe and asia. nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by us as well as third-party manufacturing facilities, in china, malaysia and taiwan. we also have international sales operations. international sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 77% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 85% for the year ended 2013. we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. the political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:        expropriation;        changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions;        changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;        difficulties in protecting our intellectual property;        difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;        changes in foreign currency exchange rates;        restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;        changes in freight and interest rates;        disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities;        loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and        compliance with u.s. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act. in addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. for example, our sunnyvale operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california. any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. the consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets.   31 table of contents unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the canadian dollar. as a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in u.s. dollars. fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. an appreciation of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third-party distributors. from time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. in addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad. any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. in addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. in jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. from time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. for example, on january 15, 2014, a complaint was filed against us seeking damages for alleged securities law violations, which is described in part 1, item 3: legal proceedings below. we also sell products to consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims. on occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that   32 table of contents this alleged exposure caused harm. litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. any claim that is successfully asserted against us, including in the january 15, 2014 complaint filed against us, may result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. with respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. if any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. in the event that we do not obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. the award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. we could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. a variety of environmental laws that we are subject to could result in additional costs and liabilities. our operations and properties have in the past and continue to be subject to various united states and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. if we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. certain environmental laws, including the u.s. comprehensive, environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, or the superfund act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. we have been named as a responsible party at three superfund sites in sunnyvale, california. although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future. in addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities.   33 table of contents environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. for example, the eu and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. these regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. as regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. recent u.s. legislation includes disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use conflict minerals that originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. we will likely incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the u.s. government. also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitors products. in january 2014, intel announced that all of its microprocessor products are conflict free. our first conflict minerals report covering the 2013 calendar year is due to the sec by june 2, 2014. a number of jurisdictions including the eu, australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on energy star specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. there is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in the united states, canada and other foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.   item 1b. unresolved
