item 1a.  risk factors the following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business. they are not the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. all patent acquisition, development, licensing and enforcement activities are conducted solely by certain of our wholly and majority-owned operating subsidiaries. risks related to our business       we have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.   despite reporting net income of $59.5 million and $21.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, we reported a net loss of $56.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and, on a cumulative basis, we have sustained substantial losses since our inception. as of december 31, 2013, our accumulated deficit was $62.1 million. as of december 31, 2013, we had approximately $256.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and working capital of $247.7 million. we expect to continue incurring significant legal, marketing and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. as a result, we anticipate that we may incur losses in the future. we believe, however, that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.   if we encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that require us to obtain additional working capital, and we cannot obtain additional working capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business may suffer.  10   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $256.7 million and $311.3 million at december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. to date, we have relied primarily upon net cash flows from our operations and from the public and private sale of equity securities to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.   we may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. as a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through bank credit facilities, public or private debt or equity financings, or otherwise. if we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. if we fail to obtain additional working capital, as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   failure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.   our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. further, as our subsidiary companies’ businesses grow, we will be required to continue to manage multiple relationships. any further growth by us or our subsidiary companies, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.   our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our subsidiaries.   as our operating subsidiaries grow, the administrative demands upon us and our operating subsidiaries will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. these demands include increased accounting, management, legal services, staff support, and general office services. we may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results. potential acquisitions may present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition.  our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to acquire patented technologies, patent portfolios, or companies holding such patented technologies and patent portfolios. accordingly, we have engaged in acquisitions to expand our patent portfolios and we intend to continue to explore such acquisitions. such acquisitions are subject to numerous risks, including the following: • our inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition; • difficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity; • our inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific acquisition; • our inability to retain key personnel from the acquired company, if necessary; • difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration process;   • diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns; and • failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies. if we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business could be adversely affected. our revenues are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition.    11 from january 2005 to the present, our operating subsidiaries have executed our business strategy of acquiring patent portfolios and accompanying patent rights. currently, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries own or control the rights to over 200 patent portfolios which include u.s. patents and certain foreign counterparts, covering technologies used in a wide variety of industries. these acquisitions continue to expand and diversify our revenue generating opportunities. we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, anticipated cash flow from operations, proceeds from prior offerings of our common stock (refer to “liquidity and capital resources” below) and other external sources of available credit, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least march 2015 and for the foreseeable future. however, due to the nature of our licensing business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of license and other fees from potential infringers, stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the growth rates of our existing licensees and certain other factors, our revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly results to fall below market expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   our operating subsidiaries depend upon relationships with others to provide technology-based opportunities that can develop into profitable royalty-bearing licenses, and if they are unable to maintain and generate new relationships, then they may not be able to sustain existing levels of revenue or increase revenue.   neither we nor our operating subsidiaries invent new technologies or products; rather, we depend upon the identification and acquisition of new patents and inventions through our relationships with inventors, universities, research institutions, technology companies and others. if our operating subsidiaries are unable to maintain those relationships and to continue to grow new relationships, then they may not be able to identify new technology-based opportunities for sustainable revenue and growth.   our current or future relationships may not provide the volume or quality of technologies necessary to sustain our business. in some cases, universities and other technology sources may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize technologies. universities may receive financing for basic research in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize resulting inventions. these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources and potential clients to whom we can market our services. if we are unable to maintain current relationships and sources of technology or to secure new relationships and sources of technology, such inability may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.   the success of our operating subsidiaries depends in part upon their ability to retain the best legal counsel to represent them in patent enforcement litigation.   the success of our licensing business depends upon our operating subsidiaries’ ability to retain the best legal counsel to prosecute patent infringement litigation. as our operating subsidiaries’ patent enforcement actions increase, it will become more difficult to find the best legal counsel to handle all of our cases because many of the best law firms may have a conflict of interest that prevents their representation of our subsidiaries. we spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation matters. we believe that these litigation matters and others that we may in the future determine to pursue could continue for years and continue to consume significant financial and management resources. the counterparties to our litigation are sometimes large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. we cannot assure that any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us. in addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the dispute. also, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly or impossible for us to defend. unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize products.   our operating subsidiaries, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third-parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.   from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may rely upon representations and warranties made by third-parties from whom our operating subsidiaries acquired patents or the exclusive rights to license and enforce patents. we also may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. in certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties, and opinions are made. by relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, our operating subsidiaries may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  12 in connection with patent enforcement actions conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court may rule that we or our subsidiaries have violated certain statutory, regulatory, federal, local or governing rules or standards, which may expose us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.   in connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may request and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. in such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or our operating subsidiaries or award attorney’s fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if we or our operating subsidiaries are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys’ fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.   our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing, legal and sales efforts may be unsuccessful. we expect our operating subsidiaries to incur significant marketing, legal and sales expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. we will also spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. as such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins. if our efforts to educate prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement are unsuccessful, we may need to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights. we may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of our existing license agreements, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. the costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations. risks related to our industry   our exposure to uncontrollable outside influences, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the united states patent and trademark office, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement business and results of operations.   our licensing and enforcement business is subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:   new legislation, regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue.   our operating subsidiaries acquire patents with enforcement opportunities and spend a significant amount of resources to enforce those patents. if new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by congress, the u.s. patent and trademark office, or uspto, or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, such changes could negatively affect our expenses and revenue. recently, united states patent laws were amended with the enactment of the leahy-smith america invents act, or the america invents act, which took effect on march 16, 2013. the america invents act includes a number of significant changes to u.s. patent law. in general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. for example, the america invents act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. in addition, the america invents act enacted a new inter-partes review (“ipr”) process at the uspto which can be used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. at this time, it is not clear what, if any, impact the america invents act will have on the operation of our enforcement business. however, the america invents act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. in addition, the u.s. department of justice, or the doj, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. it is possible that the findings and  13 recommendations of the doj could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. also, the federal trade commission, or ftc, has published its intent to initiate a proposed study under section 6(b) of the federal trade commission act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of patent assertion entities, or paes.  the ftc’s notice and request for public comment relating to the pae study appeared in the federal register on october 3rd, 2013.  it is anticipated that acacia research corporation and/or certain of its subsidiaries will be subject to this ftc study which would require the collection of certain information as detailed in notice published by the ftc.  it is expected that the results of the pae study by the ftc will be provided to congress and other agencies, such as the doj, who could take action, including legislative proposals, based on the results of the study.      finally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.   changes in patent law could adversely impact our business. patent laws may continue to change, and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. for instance, the united states house of representatives passed a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met. trial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patents.   it is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. it is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.   more patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the uspto.   certain of our operating subsidiaries hold and continue to acquire pending patents. we have identified a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. the application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from these patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.   federal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.   our patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. criminal cases always take priority over our actions. as a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.   any reductions in the funding of the uspto could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.   the assets of our operating subsidiaries consist of patent portfolios, including pending patent applications before the uspto. the value of our patent portfolios is dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the uspto could negatively impact the value of our assets. further, reductions in funding from congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the uspto, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.    14 competition is intense in the industries in which our subsidiaries do business and as a result, we may not be able to grow or maintain our market share for our technologies and patents.   we expect to encounter competition in the area of patent acquisition and enforcement as the number of companies entering this market is increasing. this includes competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire. entities including rpx, ast, intellectual ventures, wi-lan, mosaid, round rock research llc, ipvalue management inc., vringo inc. and pendrell corporation compete in acquiring rights to patents, and we expect more entities to enter the market. as new technological advances occur, many of our patented technologies may become obsolete before they are completely monetized. if we are unable to replace obsolete technologies with more technologically advanced patented technologies, then this obsolescence could have a negative effect on our ability to generate future revenues.   our licensing business also competes with venture capital firms and various industry leaders for patent licensing opportunities. many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do. as we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently rely upon to generate future revenue.   our patented technologies face uncertain market value.   our operating subsidiaries have acquired patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.   as patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.   we believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents. as a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the patent or pay damages for lost royalties. this may increase the risks associated with an investment in our company.   the markets served by our operating subsidiaries are subject to rapid technological change, and if our operating subsidiaries are unable to develop and acquire new technologies and patents, our ability to generate revenues could be substantially impaired.   the markets served by our operating subsidiaries and their licensees frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. products for communications applications and high-speed computing applications, as well as other applications covered by our operating subsidiaries’ intellectual property, are based on continually evolving industry standards. in addition, the communications industry is intensely competitive and has been impacted by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition. our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. this will require our continued efforts and success in acquiring new patent portfolios with licensing and enforcement opportunities. while we expect for the foreseeable future to have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to maintain the level of acquisitions necessary to keep pace with these technological advances, various factors may require us to have greater liquidity and capital resources than we currently expect. if we are unable to acquire new patented technologies and patent portfolios, or to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards, our ability to generate revenues could be substantially impaired and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.   uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   our revenue-generating opportunities depend on the use of our patented technologies by existing and prospective licensees, the overall demand for the products and services of our licensees, and on the overall economic and financial health of our licensees. although economic conditions appear to be improving, recent uncertainties in global economic conditions have resulted in the tightening of the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. if economic conditions do not continue to improve, or if they further deteriorate, many of our licensees’ customers, which may rely on credit financing, may delay or reduce their purchases of our licensees’ products and services. in addition, the use or adoption of our patented technologies is often based on current and forecasted demand for our licensees’ products and services in the marketplace and may require companies to make significant initial commitments of  15 capital and other resources. if negative conditions in the global credit markets delay or prevent our licensees’ and their customers’ access to credit, overall consumer spending on the products and services of our licensees may decrease and the adoption or use of our patented technologies may slow, respectively. further, if the markets in which our licensees’ participate do not continue to improve, or deteriorate further, this could negatively impact our licensees’ long-term sales and revenue generation, margins and operating expenses, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   in addition, we have significant patent-related intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our patent-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis, and we may incur substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our consolidated financial results. there can be no assurance that the outcome of such reviews in the future will not result in substantial impairment charges. impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs, holding periods or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows. although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable, significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result.   risks related to our common stock   the availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.   in the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations and acquisitions. we may also pay for interests in additional subsidiary companies by using shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. we may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. any of these events may dilute stockholders’ ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.   in addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.   delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.   provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. these provisions include:   • section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;   • amendment of our bylaws by the stockholders requires a two-thirds approval of the outstanding shares;   • the authorization in our certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover;    • provisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders’ rights to call a special meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board of directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and    • the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms for each class, which could make it more difficult for an outsider to gain control of our board of directors.   together, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.     16 we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.   our reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. it is possible that in future periods, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. the following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:   • the dollar amount of agreements executed in each period, which is primarily driven by the nature and characteristics of the technology being licensed and the magnitude of infringement associated with a specific licensee;     • the specific terms and conditions of agreements executed in each period and the periods of infringement contemplated by the respective payments;     • fluctuations in the total number of agreements executed;     • fluctuations in the sales results or other royalty-per-unit activities of our licensees that impact the calculation of license fees due;     • the timing of the receipt of periodic license fee payments and/or reports from licensees;     • fluctuations in the net number of active licensees period to period;     • costs related to acquisitions, alliances, licenses and other efforts to expand our operations;   • the timing of payments under the terms of any customer or license agreements into which our operating subsidiaries may enter;    • expenses related to, and the timing and results of, patent filings and other enforcement proceedings relating to intellectual property rights, as more fully described in this section; and • new litigation or developments in current litigation and the unpredictability of litigation results or settlements.     technology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.   the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile. we believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:   • announcements of developments in our patent enforcement actions;     • developments or disputes concerning our patents;     • our or our competitors’ technological innovations;   • developments in relationships with licensees;     • variations in our quarterly operating results;   •  our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts’ expectations of our financial results;    • a change in financial estimates or securities analysts’ recommendations;     • changes in management’s or securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance;     • changes in market valuations of similar companies; • the current sovereign debt crises affecting several countries in the european union and concerns about sovereign debt of the united states;  17     • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and   • failure to complete significant transactions.       for example, the nasdaq-100 technology sector index (ndxt) had a range of $1,421.19 - $1,911.53 during the 52-weeks ended december 31, 2013 and the nasdaq composite index (ixic) had a range of $3,076.60-$4,177.73 over the same period. over the same period, our common stock fluctuated within a range of $12.23 - $32.59.   the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. as noted above, our stock price, like many others, has fluctuated significantly in recent periods and if investors have concerns that our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by global economic conditions, our stock price could continue to fluctuate significantly in future periods.   in addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by court rulings and/or other developments in our patent licensing and enforcement actions. court rulings in patent enforcement actions are often difficult to understand, even when favorable or neutral to the value of our patents and our overall business, and we believe that investors in the market may overreact, causing fluctuations in our stock prices that may not accurately reflect the impact of court rulings on our business operations and assets.   in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. if our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results. item 1b. unresolved
