item 1a. risk factors. you should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k when evaluating our business and financial condition and an investment in our common stock. should any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, such developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. our businesses face significant competition in the industries in which they operate. many of our products and services face direct competition from companies offering similar products or services. competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. intense competition is expected to continue in these markets. however, we believe our diversification strategy of entering and expanding our offerings in high return markets and our focus on improved efficiencies is the key to maintaining our market share and growth rates in these markets. if we are unable to realize our objectives, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. in our energy and mining operations, we compete primarily with a small number of global and national companies in the pipe coating industry, with specialty firms in the pipeline protection industry, with a limited number of large firms globally and a large number of smaller firms regionally in the cathodic protection industry and with a limited number of regional and national companies 16 in the oil and gas engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and turnaround industries. in addition, customers can select a variety of methods to meet their pipe installation, rehabilitation, coating and cathodic protection needs, including methods that we do not offer. however, because of the breadth of high quality products and services we offer, we maintain a significant market presence and enjoy brand-name recognition worldwide in each of these fields. in the water and wastewater rehabilitation markets, we face competition from companies providing similar products and services as well as companies providing other methods of rehabilitation that we do not offer, including traditional dig-and-replace, which is still the preferred method in the water rehabilitation market. in the trenchless wastewater rehabilitation market, cipp is the preferred method. in the trenchless wastewater market, few significant barriers to entry exist and, as a result, any organization that has the financial resources and access to technical expertise and bonding may become a competitor. although we compete with many smaller firms on a local or regional level, and with several larger firms on the global and national levels, we have been able to maintain our presence as the global leader in this field. in water rehabilitation, there are more significant barriers to entry, since it is strictly regulated. in this market, we compete with a smaller number of specialty contractors around the world. in our commercial and structural segment, the frp process competes against traditional methods of structural retrofitting, but is gaining rapid acceptance in the construction and retrofitting industry. fibrwrap has been performing successful installations of frp systems for 24 years. in the frp field, together fyfe and fibrwrap are one of the only companies offering manufacturing, engineering and technical expertise, as well extensive installation experience. given there are significant barriers to entry, including testing requirements, experience, intellectual property and certifications, in manufacturing we only compete with a handful of frp suppliers and in installation, we compete with a number of frp installers. if any of our competitors were to become fully-integrated like us or if new entrants in the market were to develop strong installation and manufacturing expertise this could adversely impact our ability to grow revenues in this market. our success and growth strategy depend on our senior management and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. we depend on our senior management for the success and future growth of the operations and revenues of our company, and the loss of any member of our senior management could have an adverse impact on our operations. such a loss may be a distraction to senior management as we search for a qualified replacement, could result in significant recruiting, relocation, training and other costs and could cause operational inefficiencies as a replacement becomes familiar with our business and operations. in addition, we use a multi-level sales force structured around target markets and key accounts, focusing on marketing our products and services to engineers, consultants, administrators, technical staff and elected officials. we are dependent on our personnel to continue to develop improvements to our proprietary processes, including materials used and the methods of manufacturing, installing, strengthening, coating and cathodic protection and we require quality field personnel to effectively and profitably perform our work. our success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply of general economic conditions, as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment. our failure to attract, train, integrate, engage and retain qualified personnel could have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our business depends upon the maintenance of our proprietary technologies and information. we depend upon our proprietary technologies and information, many of which are no longer subject to patent protection. we rely principally upon trade secret and copyright laws to protect our proprietary technologies. we regularly enter into confidentiality agreements with our key employees, customers and potential customers and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. these measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to assure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. in addition, the laws of other countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. we are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify such expenses. our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing technologies and customer requirements by enhancing our existing products and services. we will need to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, features and services that address the needs of our customer base. as a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. we cannot assure that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. in addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenues to justify the expenses and resources devoted to this product diversification effort. 17 acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations. acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. the process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. the areas where we face risks include: • diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges. • failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology. • implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company. • integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions. • transition of operations, users and customers onto our existing platforms. • failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition. • in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire. • liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities. • litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations. also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. our backlog is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. our backlog, which at december 31, 2013 was approximately $759.0 million, inclusive of brinderson, is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellation. the revenues projected in this backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. we may be unable to complete some projects included in our backlog in the estimated time and, as a result, such projects could remain in backlog for extended periods of time. to the extent that we experience project cancellation or scope adjustments, we could face a reduction in the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues that we actually receive from such backlog. in addition, one or more of our multi-year contracts have in the past and may in the future contribute a material portion of our backlog in any one year. the loss of business from any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. some accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. by their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods. 18 our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded results. we employ the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for our construction projects. this methodology recognizes revenues and profits over the life of a project based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated project costs. revisions to revenues and profits are made once amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made. revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized. for the year ended december 31, 2013, approximately 75% of our revenues were derived from percentage-of-completion accounting. we may experience cost overruns on our projects. we typically conduct our business under guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of materials and other exigencies. our profitability depends heavily on our ability to make accurate estimates. inaccurate estimates, or changes in other circumstances, such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials or our suppliers’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform could result in substantial losses, as such changes adversely affect the revenue and gross profit recognized on each project. our recognition of revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work could be subject to reversal in future periods. we recognize revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work as set forth in our written contracts with our clients when management believes that realization of these revenues is probable and the recoverable amounts can be reasonably estimated. we also factor in all other information that we possess with respect to the change order to determine whether the change order should be recognized at all and, if recognition is appropriate, what dollar amount of the change order should be recognized. due to factors that we may not anticipate at the time of recognition, however, revenues ultimately received on these change orders could be less than revenues that we recognized in a prior reporting period or periods, which could require us in subsequent reporting periods to reduce or reverse revenues and gross profit previously recognized. we may be liable to complete the work of our joint venture partners under our joint venture arrangements. we enter into contractual joint ventures in order to develop joint bids on certain contracts. the success of these joint ventures depends largely on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their obligations under the joint venture. under these joint venture arrangements, we may be required to complete our joint venture partner’s portion of the contract if the partner is unable to complete its portion and a bond is not available. in such case, the additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture. international trade tariffs and restrictions in the steel market may adversely affect our bayou business. the business of our subsidiary, bayou, is heavily dependent on providing products and services to customers that import steel pipe into the united states from the international markets. to the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the united states increase the price of, or limit the amount of, steel pipe imported into the united states, the demand from bayou’s customers for bayou’s products and services will be diminished, which will adversely affect bayou’s revenues and profitability. federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as governmental reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect our energy and mining customers. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays. our energy and mining segment services oil and gas companies in the shale plays and we foresee strong market opportunities here. a decline in drilling of new wells and related servicing activities caused by these initiatives could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. cyclical downturns in the mining, oil and natural gas industries, or in the oil field, refinery and mining services businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. the mining, oil and natural gas industries are highly cyclical. demand for the majority of our oil field, refinery and mining products and services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the mining, oil and natural gas industries for the exploration, development and production of mined minerals, crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to the prices of these commodities and generally dependent on the industry’s view of future mined mineral, oil and natural gas prices. there are numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for our products and services, which include, but are not limited to: • market prices of mined minerals, oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices; 19 • cost of producing mined minerals, oil and natural gas; • the level of mining, drilling and production activity; • the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves; • mergers, consolidations and downsizing among our clients; • coordination by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec); • the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients; • financial condition of our client base and their ability to fund capital and maintenance expenditures; • adverse weather conditions; • civil unrest in oil-producing countries; • level of consumption of minerals, oil, natural gas and petrochemicals by consumers; and • availability of services and materials for our clients to grow their capital expenditures. the mining, oil and natural gas industries have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oil field, refinery and mining pipeline protection products and services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. a significant downturn in the mining, oil and/or natural gas industries could result in a reduction in demand for oil field and refinery services and could adversely affect our operating results. our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from the u.s. government regulations on offshore drilling projects. in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010, the u.s. government implemented various new regulations intended to improve offshore drilling safety and environmental protection and increase liability for oil spills in the federal waters of the outer continental shelf. these new regulations increased the complexity of the drilling permit process and have delayed the receipt of drilling permits in both deepwater and shallow-water areas since the incident. while there has been an increase in the number of drilling permits issued, and drilling activity is recovering, we cannot predict what the continuing effects from the u.s. government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers in our energy and mining segment or other industry participants in response to these regulations. this could reduce demand for our services, which could have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business. our operations could be adversely impacted by new california legislation related to downstream work performed in california refineries. in our energy and mining operations, our brinderson operation may face challenges with the addition of section 25536.7 to the california health and safety code on january 1, 2014. the law introduces new requirements for refineries and outside contractors at covered facilities when construction, alteration, demolition, installation, repair or maintenance work is performed at the covered facility. the law imposes the following new requirements: • all subject workers must be paid the applicable prevailing wage rate; • all subject workers must be either “skilled journeymen” or “registered apprentices”; and • commencing january 1, 2014, at least 30% of skilled journeypersons on the project must be graduates of certified apprenticeship programs, which percentage increases to 45% on january 1, 2015 and 60% on january 1, 2016. the new requirements only pertain to contracts entered into, extended or renewed after january 1, 2014. brinderson currently has long term contracts in place with its major downstream clients, but its operations may be adversely impacted to become fully compliant with section 25536.7 of the california health and safety code when the contracts expire. operational disruptions caused by political instability and conflict in the middle east could adversely impact our current operations and plans of expansion in the middle east. our energy and mining segment currently operates in the middle east and continues to focus efforts on accelerating expansion into the middle east. political and social unrest in the middle east, as well as the potential for catastrophic events such as abrupt political change, terrorist acts and conflicts or wars may cause damage or disruption to the economy, financial markets and our current and prospective customers in the middle east. 20 the general downturn in u.s. and global economic conditions, and specifically a downturn in the municipal bond market, may reduce our business prospects and decrease our revenues and cash flows. our business is affected by general economic conditions. any extended weakness in the u.s. and global economies could reduce our business prospects and could cause decreases in our revenues and operating cash flows. specifically, a downturn in the municipal bond market caused by an actual downgrade of monoline insurers could result in our municipal customers being required to spend municipal funds previously allocated to projects that would benefit our business to pay off outstanding bonds. we conduct manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to a variety of risks associated with doing business outside the united states. we maintain significant international operations, including operations in canada, europe, asia-pacific, australia, the middle east, south america and latin america. for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 38.4%, 42.1% and 41.7%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from international operations. we expect a significant portion of our revenues and profits to come from international operations and joint ventures for the foreseeable future and to continue to grow over time. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks and complications associated with international manufacturing, sales, services and other operations. these include: • difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; • foreign customers with longer payment cycles than customers in the united states; • tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings subject to withholding requirements; • tax laws that restrict our ability to use tax credits, offset gains or repatriate funds; • tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country; • abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations; • unsettled political conditions; • difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights or weaker intellectual property right protections in some countries; • hostility from local populations, particularly in the middle east; and • difficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the foreign corrupt practices act. to the extent that our international operations are affected by these unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses that could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. implementation and achievement of international growth objectives also may be impeded by political, social and economic uncertainties or unrest in countries in which we conduct operations or market or distribute our products. in addition, compliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive. for example, we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations. our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages and other labor matters. our brinderson business has approximately 2,400 employees, approximately 2,300 of whom are located in california, where employees predominantly are represented by unions. although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and we have had no strikes or work stoppages, no assurances can be made that we will not experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor. none of our brinderson employees participate in multi-employer benefit plans. 21 the loss of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect us. one or more customers have in the past and may in the future contribute a material portion of our revenues in any one year. because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects or for specific periods of time, we may lose these customers from year to year as the projects or maintenance contracts are completed. the loss of business from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. we may incur significant costs in providing services in excess of original project scope without having an approved change order. after commencement of a contract, we may perform, without the benefit of an approved change order from the customer, additional services requested by the customer that were not contemplated in our contract price for various reasons, including customer changes or incomplete or inaccurate engineering, changes in project specifications and other similar information provided to us by the customer. our construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred under these circumstances. a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record in the current period an adjustment to revenue and profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. any such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly for the period in which such adjustments are made. we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, approved change orders in an amount adequate to compensate us for our additional work or expenses. our profitability could be negatively impacted if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization of our workforce. the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. if we under utilize our workforce, our project gross margins and overall profitability suffer in the short-term. if we over utilize our workforce, we may negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction and project execution, which could result in a decline of future project awards. the utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors including: • our estimate of the headcount requirements for various units based upon our forecast of the demand for our products and services; • our ability to maintain our talent base and manage attrition; • our ability to schedule our portfolio of projects to efficiently utilize our employees and minimize downtown between project assignments; and • our need to invest time and resources into functions such as training, business development, employee recruiting, and sales that are not chargeable to customer projects. an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and in particular, engineers, project managers, linemen and skilled craft workers, could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, which could harm our business and impair our future revenues and profitability. our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, project managers, linemen, skilled craftsmen and other experienced professionals in accordance with our needs is an important factor in our ability to maintain profitability and grow our business. the market for these professionals is competitive, particularly during periods of economic growth when the supply is limited. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to retain or attract qualified personnel when needed. therefore, when we anticipate or experience growing demand for our services, we may incur additional cost to maintain a professional staff in excess of our current contract needs in an effort to have sufficient qualified personnel available to address this anticipated demand. if we do incur additional compensation and benefit costs, our customer contracts may not allow us to pass through these costs. competent and experienced engineers, project managers, and craft workers are especially critical to the profitable performance of our contracts, particularly on our fixed-price contracts where superior design and execution of the project can result in profits greater than originally estimated or where inferior design and project execution can reduce or eliminate estimated profits or even result in a loss. our project managers are involved in most aspects of contracting and contract execution including: • supervising the bidding process, including providing estimates of significant cost components, such as material and equipment needs, and the size, productivity and composition of the workforce; • negotiating contracts; • supervising project performance, including performance by our employees, subcontractors and other third-party suppliers and vendors 22 • estimating costs for completion of contracts that is used to estimate amounts that can be reported as revenues and earnings on the contract under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting; • negotiating requests for change orders and the final terms of approved change orders; and • determining and documenting claims by us for increased costs incurred due to the failure of customers, subcontractors and other third- party suppliers of equipment and materials to perform on a timely basis and in accordance with contract terms. we have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuation. global financial and credit markets have been, and continue to be, unstable and unpredictable. worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may deteriorate further. for example, the credit issues in the european union as a result of the sovereign debt crisis and other factors have affected economies worldwide. the instability of the markets and weakness of the economy could continue to affect the demand for our services, the financial strength of our customers and suppliers, their ability or willingness to do business with us, our willingness to do business with them, and/or our suppliers’ and customers’ ability to fulfill their obligations to us and/or the ability of us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain credit. these factors could adversely affect our operations, earnings and financial condition. a significant portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, which may result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our u.s. dollar costs for, or reduce our u.s. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. our water and wastewater rehabilitation revenues are substantially dependent on municipal government spending. many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies and, as such, we are dependent on municipal spending. spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. consequently, future municipal spending may not be allocated to projects that would benefit our business or may not be allocated in the amounts or for the size of the projects that we anticipated. a decrease in municipal spending on such projects would adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. the execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for our customers. the economic climate has resulted in tighter credit markets, which has adversely affected our customers’ ability to secure the financing necessary to proceed or continue with pipe or other infrastructure installation, rehabilitation, strengthening, coating and cathodic protection projects. our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new projects or the suspension of projects already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings. a substantial portion of our raw materials is from a limited number of vendors, and we are subject to market fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities. the primary products and raw materials used by our corrpro operations include zinc, aluminum, magnesium and other metallic anodes, as well as wire and cable. we believe that corrpro has multiple sources available for these raw materials and is not dependent on any single vendor to meet its supply needs. the prices of these raw materials have historically been affected by the prices of energy, petroleum, steel and other commodities, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency and exchange rates. a significant increase in the prices of these raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations. we purchase the majority of our fiber requirements for tube manufacturing from two sources. we believe, however, that alternate sources are readily available, and we continue to negotiate with other supply sources. the manufacture of the tubes used in our rehabilitation business is dependent upon the availability of resin, a petroleum-based product. we currently have qualified four resin suppliers from which we intend to purchase the majority of our resin requirements for our north american operations. for our european operations, we currently have qualified six resin suppliers and for our asia-pacific operations, we currently have qualified six resin suppliers.  we believe that these and other sources of resin supply are readily available. historically, resin prices have fluctuated on the basis of the prevailing prices of oil, and we anticipate that prices will continue to be heavily influenced by the events affecting the oil market. the primary products and raw materials used by our commercial and structural segment in the manufacture of frp composite systems are carbon, glass, resins, fabric, and epoxy raw materials. carbon and epoxies are the largest materials purchased, which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers, although we believe these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors. the price of epoxy historically is affected by the price of oil. in addition, a number of factors such as 23 worldwide demand, labor costs, energy costs, import duties and other trade restrictions may influence the price of these raw materials. we also purchase a significant volume of fuel to operate our trucks and equipment. at present, we do not engage in any type of hedging activities to mitigate the risks of fluctuating market prices for oil or fuel. a significant increase in the price of oil could cause an adverse effect on our cost structure that we may not be able to recover from our customers. extreme weather conditions may adversely affect our operations. we are likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain or hurricanes, typhoons, snow and ice or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. our water and wastewater rehabilitation segments are particularly sensitive to weather extremes. delays and other weather impacts could adversely affect our ability to meet project deadlines and may increase a project’s cost and decrease its profitability. certain of our facilities are located in regions that may be affected by natural disasters. certain of our bayou facilities are located on the gulf coast in louisiana. this region is subject to increased hurricane activity that can result in substantial flooding. our bayou facilities have in the past experienced damage due to winds and floods. although we maintain flood loss insurance where necessary, a hurricane, flood or other natural disaster could result in significant damage to our facilities, recovery costs and interruption to certain of our operations. our brinderson business serves large oil and gas customers in california and is headquartered in costa mesa, california with operations throughout california, near major earthquake faults. furthermore, our fyfe/fibrwrap business has substantial operations in california near major earthquake faults. while we carry earthquake insurance, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems or our clients’ facilities could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. business operations could be adversely affected by terrorism. the threat of, or actual acts of, terrorism may affect our operations around the world in unpredictable ways and may force an increase in security measures and cause disruptions in supplies and markets. if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing facilities, or if any of the projects we are working on, particularly in the energy and mining sector, were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, our operations could be adversely affected. corresponding instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could adversely affect our ability to raise capital. we may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which could disrupt our operations and could result in a loss of assets. we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers, as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. information technology system failures, including suppliers’ or vendors’ system failures, could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers, impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products, other business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or the loss of employee personal information. these events could impact our customers, employees and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we occasionally access the financial markets to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs. our ability to access these markets may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations or implement our operating strategy. we occasionally borrow under our existing credit facility to fund operations, including working capital investments. market disruptions such as those experienced in the united states and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, resulting in the unavailability of certain types of financing. uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. these disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade and general economic downturns in the areas where we do business. if we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategy could be adversely affected. we are subject to a number of restrictive debt

of july 1, 2018. at december 31, 2013, $341.3 million of the term loan and $35.5 million of the line of credit was outstanding. our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets or sell assets, make investments and make other restricted payments. our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions and satisfy financial condition tests. our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests and otherwise comply with our financial covenants may be affected by the factors described in this “risk factors” section of this report and other factors outside our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those ratios, tests and covenants. our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control. a breach of any of these covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions, as applicable, or any inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due could result in an event of default. upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. at december 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as required under the credit facility. if we are unable to comply with the restrictive covenants in the future, we would be required to obtain amendments or waivers from our lenders or secure another source of financing. if our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis. in addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. as a holding company, aegion depends on its operating subsidiaries to
