item 1a. risk factors investing in apollo investment involves a number of significant risks related to our business, structure, investments and investment in our common stock. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective. certain risks in the current environment capital markets have recently been in a period of disruption and instability. these market conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the united states and abroad, which have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our business and operations. the global capital markets have been in a period of disruption as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of certain major financial institutions. despite actions of the united states federal government and foreign governments, these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. these conditions could continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future. while these conditions persist, we and other companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital. equity capital may be difficult to raise because subject to some limited exceptions, as a bdc, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value without general approval by our shareholders and approval of the specific issuance by our board. in addition, our ability to incur indebtedness (including by issued preferred stock) is limited by applicable regulations such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 act, must equal at least 200% immediately after each time we incur indebtedness. the debt capital that will be available, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions in the future. any inability to raise capital could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, market conditions have made, and may in the future make, it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if required. as a result, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments. given the extreme volatility and dislocation that the capital markets have experienced, many bdcs have faced, and may in the future face, a challenging environment in which to raise capital. recent significant changes in the capital markets affecting our ability to raise capital have affected the pace of our investment activity. in addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including the extreme volatility and disruption, have had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. an inability to raise capital, and any required sale of our investments for liquidity purposes, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.   9 table of contents the recent instability in the financial markets has led the u.s. government to take a number of unprecedented actions and pass legislation designed to regulate and support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility, and in some cases a lack of liquidity. on july 21, 2010, the president signed into law major financial services reform legislation in the form of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act). the dodd-frank act, among other things, grants regulatory authorities such as the commodity futures trading commission and sec broad rulemaking authority to implement various provisions of the dodd-frank act, including comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market. it is unclear how these regulators will exercise these revised and expanded powers and whether they will undertake rulemaking, supervisory or enforcement actions that would adversely affect us or our investments. possible regulatory actions taken under these revised and expanded powers may include actions related to financial consumer protection, proprietary trading and derivatives. there can be no assurance that future regulatory actions authorized by the dodd-frank act will not significantly reduce our profitability. the implementation of the dodd-frank act could adversely affect us by increasing transaction and/or regulatory compliance costs. in addition, greater regulatory scrutiny may increase our exposure to potential liabilities. increased regulatory oversight can also impose administrative burdens on us and on aim, including, without limitation, responding to examinations or investigations and implementing new policies and procedures. additionally, federal, state, and other governments, their regulatory agencies or self regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the securities in which we invest, or the issuers of such securities, in ways that are unforeseeable. governments or their agencies may also acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions. the implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear, and such a program may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity, valuation and performance of our portfolio companies. furthermore, volatile financial markets can expose us to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing securities. at any time after the date hereof, legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect our portfolio companies. changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact on the entities in which we invest. legislation or regulation may also change the way in which we are regulated. there can be no assurance that the dodd-frank act or any future legislation, regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on us or will not impair our ability to achieve our investment objective. risks relating to our business and structure we may suffer credit losses. investment in small and middle-market companies is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk of credit loss. these risks are likely to increase during volatile economic periods, as the us and many other economies have experienced. we are dependent upon apollo investment managements key personnel for our future success and upon their access to apollos investment professionals and partners. we depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of aim. members of our senior management may depart at any time. we also depend, to a significant extent, on aims access to the investment professionals and partners of apollo and the information and deal flow generated by the apollo investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. the senior management of aim evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes and monitors our investments. our future success depends on the continued service of the senior management team of aim. the departure of any senior managers of aim, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of apollo, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. in addition, we can offer no assurance that aim will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to apollos partners and investment professionals or its information and deal flow.   10 table of contents our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively. our ability to achieve our investment objective depends, in part, on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on aims ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of aims structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms. the senior management team of aim has substantial responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement, and with respect to certain members, in connection with their roles as officers of other apollo funds. they may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. these demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. in order to grow, we and aim need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. a number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. we compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. competition for investment opportunities intensifies from time to time and may intensify further in the future. some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. for example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. in addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and valuation requirements that the 1940 act imposes on us as a bdc. we cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, as a result of this existing and potentially increasing competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. we do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. we may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms and structure. if we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss. any failure on our part to maintain our status as a bdc would reduce our operating flexibility. if we do not remain a bdc, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility. we will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a ric. to qualify as a ric under the code, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. the annual distribution requirement for a ric is satisfied if we distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. to the extent we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements and other financial covenants under loan and credit agreements, and could in some circumstances also become subject to such requirements under the 1940 act, that could, under certain   11 table of contents circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a ric. if we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a ric and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. to qualify as a ric, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of ric status. because most of our investments are in private companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. if we fail to qualify as a ric for any reason and become subject to corporate-level income tax, the resulting corporate-level taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. to qualify again to be taxed as a ric in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our earnings and profits attributable to non-ric years reduced by an interest charge on 50% of such earnings and profits payable by us to the irs. in addition, if we failed to qualify as a ric for a period greater than two taxable years, then we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of ten years, in order to qualify as a ric in a subsequent year. we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as pik interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and typically due at the end of the loan term or, original issue discount, which may be a feature of the loan or may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan, among other circumstances. such increases in loan balances as a result of pik arrangements or original issue discount are included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments and could be significant relative to our overall investment activities. loans structured with these features may represent a higher level of credit risk than loans the interest on which must be paid in cash at regular intervals. we also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we do not receive in cash. that part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, including for investments with pik provisions. if a portfolio company defaults on a loan, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. consequently, while we may make incentive fee payments on income accruals that we may not collect in the future and with respect to which we do not have a formal clawback right against our investment adviser per se, the amount of accrued income written off in any period will reduce the income in the period in which such write-off was taken and thereby reduce such periods incentive fee payment. since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the tax requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to maintain our status as a ric. accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations in order to meet distribution and/or leverage requirements. regulations governing our operation as a bdc affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise, additional capital. we may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 act. under the provisions of the 1940 act, we are permitted, as a bdc, to issue senior securities only in amounts such   12 table of contents that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. if the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. if that happens, the contractual arrangements governing these securities may require us to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. bdcs may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances, one of which is during the one-year period after stockholder approval. in the past, our stockholders have approved a plan so that during the subsequent 12 month period we could, in one or more public or private offerings of our common stock, sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value per share, subject to certain conditions including parameters on the level of permissible dilution, approval of the sale by a majority of our independent directors and a requirement that the sale price be not less than approximately the market price of the shares of our common stock at specified times, less the expenses of the sale. we may in the future seek to renew such authority on terms and conditions set forth in the corresponding proxy statement. there is no assurance such approvals will be obtained. in the event we sell, or otherwise issue, shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, existing stockholders will experience net asset value dilution and the investors who acquire shares in such offering may thereafter experience the same type of dilution from subsequent offerings at a discount. for example, if we sell an additional 10% of our common shares at a 5% discount from net asset value, a stockholder who does not participate in that offering for its proportionate interest will suffer net asset value dilution of up to 0.5% or $5 per $1000 of net asset value. we currently use borrowed funds to make investments and are exposed to the typical risks associated with leverage. we are exposed to increased risk of loss due to our use of debt to make investments. a decrease in the value of our investments will have a greater negative impact on the value of our common stock than if we did not use debt. our ability to pay dividends will be restricted if we fail to satisfy certain of our asset coverage ratios and other financial covenants and any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness are not available for dividends to our common stockholders. the agreements governing our debt facilities require us to comply with certain financial and operational covenants. these covenants require us to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset coverage, minimum shareholder equity and liquidity. as of march 31, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants. however, our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. in the event of deterioration in the capital markets and pricing levels subsequent to this period, net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio may increase in the future. absent an amendment to our revolving credit facility, continued unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio could result in non-compliance with certain covenants. accordingly, there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with these covenants. failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default which, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders, could accelerate repayment under the facilities and thereby have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends. our current and future debt securities are and may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. we, and indirectly our stockholders, bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock.   13 table of contents we fund a portion of our investments with borrowed money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. borrowings and other types of financing, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. our lenders have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders or any preferred stockholders. if the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. similarly, any increase in our income in excess of consolidated interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. we may in the future determine to fund a portion of our investments with preferred stock, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss and the risks of investing in us in the same way as our borrowings. preferred stock, which is another form of leverage, has the same risks to our common stockholders as borrowings because the dividends on any preferred stock we issue must be cumulative. payment of such dividends and repayment of the liquidation preference of such preferred stock must take preference over any dividends or other payments to our common stockholders, and preferred stockholders are not subject to any of our expenses or losses and are not entitled to participate in any income or appreciation in excess of their stated preference. changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. because we borrow money, and may issue preferred stock to finance investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay dividends on preferred stock and the rate at which we invest these funds. as a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. in periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase except to the extent we issue fixed rate debt or preferred stock, which could reduce our net investment income. our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 act. interest rate hedging activities do not protect against credit risk. we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense. assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical immediate 1% change in interest rates would not materially affect our investment income over a one-year horizon. in addition, we believe that our interest rate matching strategy and our ability to hedge mitigates the effects any changes in interest rates may have on our investment income. although management believes that this is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. you should also be aware that a change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rates we receive on many of our debt investments. accordingly, a change in interest rates could make it easier for us to meet or exceed the performance threshold and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.   14 table of contents we may need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income. we may need additional capital to fund growth in our investments. we have issued equity securities and have borrowed from financial institutions. a reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders to maintain our regulated investment company status. as a result, any such cash earnings may not be available to fund investment originations. we expect to continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional debt and equity securities. if we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. in addition, as a bdc, our ability to borrow or issue additional preferred stock may be restricted if our total assets are less than 200% of our total borrowings and preferred stock. many of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. a large percentage of our portfolio investments are not publicly traded. the fair value of these investments may not be readily determinable. we value these investments quarterly at fair value (based on asc 820, its corresponding guidance and the principal markets in which these investments trade) as determined in good faith by our board of directors pursuant to a written valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process utilizing the input of our investment adviser, independent valuation firms and the audit committee. our board of directors utilizes the services of independent valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of these investments. the types of factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of these investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to more liquid securities, indices and other market-related inputs, discounted cash flow, our principal market and other relevant factors. because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a readily available market for these investments existed and may differ materially from the amounts we realize on any disposition of such investments. our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments. in addition, decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. unprecedented declines in prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets have resulted in significant net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio in the past. the effect of all of these factors on our portfolio has reduced our nav by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may continue to suffer additional unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. we generally make investments in private companies. substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. in addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. in addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or an affiliated manager of apollo has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.   15 table of contents we may experience fluctuations in our periodic results. we could experience fluctuations in our periodic operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rates payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses (including the interest rates payable on our borrowings), the dividend rates on preferred stock we issue, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. as a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. there are significant potential conflicts of interest which could adversely affect our investment returns. allocation of personnel our executive officers and directors, and the partners of our investment adviser, aim, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. moreover, we note that, notwithstanding the difference in principal investment objectives between us and other apollo funds, such other apollo sponsored funds, including new affiliated potential pooled investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established (whether managed or sponsored by those apollo affiliates or aim itself), have and may from time to time have overlapping investment objectives with us and, accordingly, invest in, whether principally or secondarily, asset classes similar to those targeted by us. to the extent such other investment vehicles have overlapping investment objectives, the scope of opportunities otherwise available to us may be adversely affected and/or reduced. as a result, certain partners of aim may face conflicts in their time management and commitments as well as in the allocation of investment opportunities to other apollo funds. in addition, in the event such investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, aim our desired investment portfolio may be adversely affected. although aim endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by aim or investment managers affiliated with aim. no information barriers there are no information barriers amongst apollo and certain of its affiliates. if aim were to receive material non-public information about a particular company, or have an interest in investing in a particular company, apollo or certain of its affiliates may be prevented from investing in such company. conversely, if apollo or certain of its affiliates were to receive material non-public information about a particular company, or have an interest in investing in a particular company, we may be prevented from investing in such company. this risk may affect us more than it does other investment vehicles, as aim generally does not use information barriers that many firms implement to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material, non-public information that could influence such decisions. aims decision not to implement these barriers could prevent its investment professionals from undertaking certain transactions such as advantageous investments or dispositions that would be permissible for them otherwise. in addition, aim could in the future decide to establish information barriers, particularly as its business expands and diversifies. co-investment activity and allocation of investment opportunities aim and/or its affiliates (apollo-affiliate) and investment managers may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more other funds. in such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, aim may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. we may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. in certain circumstances negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the sec permitting us to do so. there can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.   16 table of contents apollo-affiliate has adopted allocation procedures that are intended to ensure that each fund or account managed by apollo-affiliate (apollo-advised funds) is treated in a manner that, over time, is fair and equitable. these allocation procedures have been developed taking into account the fact that (i) the apollo-advised funds tend to have broad investment mandates, but each apollo-advised fund has one or more primary investment mandates, and (ii) the apollo-advised funds may have overlapping primary investment mandates. in operating under these procedures, apollo-affiliate generally allocates investment opportunities first to the apollo-advised funds whose primary investment mandates are consistent with the investment being allocated. when more than one apollo-advised fund has a primary investment mandate that is consistent with an investment being allocated, the allocation generally is made on a pro rata basis. as a result, in situations where a security is appropriate for us but is limited in availability, we may receive a lower allocation than may be desired by our portfolio managers or no allocation if apollo-affiliate believes the investment is more appropriate for a different apollo-advised fund because of its investment mandate. investment opportunities may be allocated on a basis other than pro rata to the extent it is done in good faith and does not, or is not reasonably expected to, result in an improper disadvantage or advantage to one participating apollo-advised fund as compared to another participating apollo-advised fund. in the event investment opportunities are allocated among us and the other apollo-advised funds, we may not be able to structure our investment portfolio in the manner desired. although apollo-affiliate endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by the other apollo-advised funds or portfolio managers affiliated with aim. furthermore, we and the other apollo-advised funds may make investments in securities where the prevailing trading activity may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold by us and the other apollo-advised funds. when this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and we will be charged or credited with the average price. thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to our disadvantage. in addition, under certain circumstances, we may not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order. it is possible that the other apollo-advised funds may make investments in the same or similar securities at different times and on different terms than we do. from time to time, we and the other apollo-advised funds may make investments at different levels of an issuers capital structure or otherwise in different classes of an issuers securities. such investments may inherently give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest between or among the various classes of securities that may be held by such entities. conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding us may benefit the other apollo-advised funds. for example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by us may impair the price of the same security sold short by (and therefore benefit) one or more apollo-advised funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by us may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) one or more apollo-advised funds. aim, its affiliates and their clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which we have invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on us. as a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of our investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of aim and its affiliates or their clients, and transactions for us may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case. fees and expenses in the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to aim, and reimburse aim for certain expenses it incurs. as a result, investors in our common stock invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. as a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of aim has interests that differ from those of our common stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.   17 table of contents aim receives a quarterly incentive fee based, in part, on our pre-incentive fee income, if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. this incentive fee will not be payable to aim unless the pre-incentive net investment income exceeds the performance threshold. to the extent we or aim are able to exert influence over our portfolio companies, the quarterly pre-incentive fee may provide aim with an incentive to induce our portfolio companies to prepay interest or other obligations in certain circumstances. allocation of expenses we have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with apollo, pursuant to which apollo has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive license to use the name apollo. under the license agreement, we have the right to use the apollo name for so long as aim or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. in addition, we rent office space from aia, an affiliate of aim, and pay apollo administration our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by aia in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs, which can create conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor. in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has, from time to time, been brought against that company. if our stock price fluctuates significantly, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our business. changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business. we and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal levels. these laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business. provisions of the maryland general corporation law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. the maryland general corporation law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of apollo investment or the removal of our directors. we are subject to the maryland business combination act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 act. our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the business combination act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board of directors, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. if the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board of directors does not approve a business combination, the business combination act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. our bylaws exempt from the maryland control share acquisition act acquisitions of our common stock by any person. if we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the control share acquisition act, the control share acquisition act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. we intend to give the sec prior notice should our board of directors elect to amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the control share acquisition act. we have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. these provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.   18 table of contents we may choose to pay dividends in our own common stock, in which case you may be required to pay federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive. we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. under irs revenue procedure 2010-12, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend for a rics taxable years ending on or before december 31, 2011 could be payable in our common stock with the 10% or greater balance paid in cash. the internal revenue service has also issued (and where revenue procedure 2010-12 is not currently applicable, the internal revenue service continues to issue) private letter rulings on cash/stock dividends paid by regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts using a 20% cash standard (instead of the 10% cash standard of revenue procedure 2010-12) if certain requirements are satisfied. stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. as a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. if a u.s. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and common stock (whether pursuant to revenue procedure 2010-12, a private letter ruling or otherwise). climate change there is evidence of global climate change. climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. for example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. increased energy use due to weather changes may require additional investments by our portfolio companies engaged in the energy business in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. increases in the cost of energy also could adversely affect the cost of operations of our portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies financial condition, through decreased revenues. extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. energy companies could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against or taxes or other regulatory costs imposed on greenhouse gas emitters, based on links drawn between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. risks related to our investments our investments in prospective portfolio companies are risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment. investment in middle-market companies is speculative and involves a number of significant risks including a high degree of risk of credit loss. middle-market companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment. in addition, they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. middle-market companies are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material   19 table of contents adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us. middle-market companies also generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. in addition, our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies. we invest primarily in long-term subordinated debt, referred to as mezzanine debt and senior secured loans of middle-market companies and we may not realize gains from our equity investments. mezzanine loans are generally unsecured and junior to other indebtedness of the issuer. as a consequence, the holder of a mezzanine loan may lack adequate protection in the event the issuer becomes distressed or insolvent and will likely experience a lower recovery than more senior debtholders in the event the issuer defaults on its indebtedness. in addition, mezzanine loans of middle market companies are often highly illiquid and in adverse market conditions may experience steep declines in valuation even if they are fully performing. senior secured loans are the most senior form of indebtedness of an issuer and, due to the ability of the lender to sell the collateral to repay its loan in the event of default, the lender will likely experience more favorable recovery than more junior creditors in the event of the issuer defaults on its indebtedness. when we invest in mezzanine and senior secured loans, we have and may continue to acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. in addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. however, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results. many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. therefore, our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease during these periods if we are required to write down the values of our investments. adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. these events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results. a portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio companys ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold. we may incur additional expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. in addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we or one of our affiliates may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided significant managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. our ability to invest in public companies may be limited in certain circumstances. as a bdc, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited   20 table of contents exceptions). subject to certain exceptions for follow-on investments and distressed companies, an investment in an issuer that has outstanding securities listed on a national securities exchange may be treated as qualifying assets only if such issuer has a market capitalization that is less than $250 million at the time of such investment. our portfolio contains a limited number of portfolio companies, which subjects us to a greater risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities. a consequence of the limited number of investments in our portfolio is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if one or more of our significant portfolio company investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one significant investment. beyond our income tax diversification requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our portfolio could contain relatively few portfolio companies. our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as follow-on investments, in order to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment. we may elect not to make follow-on investments, may be constrained in our ability to employ available funds, or otherwise may lack sufficient funds to make those investments. we have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. the failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities, or because we are inhibited by compliance with bdc requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status. when we do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. we do not generally take controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. to the extent that we do not hold a controlling equity interest in a portfolio company, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments. an investment strategy focused primarily on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. we have invested and will continue to invest primarily in privately-held companies. generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of aims investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. also, privately-held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than public company competitors, which often are larger. these factors could affect our investment returns.   21 table of contents our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. we have invested and intend to invest primarily in mezzanine and senior debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. the portfolio companies usually have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. by their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. after repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. in the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. in addition, we may not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. as a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. our incentive fee may induce aim to make certain investments, including speculative investments. the incentive fee payable by us to aim may create an incentive for aim to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. the way in which the incentive fee payable to aim is determined, which is calculated separately in two components as a percentage of the net investment income (subject to a performance threshold) and as a percentage of the realized gain on invested capital, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock, including investors in offerings of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock or warrants representing rights to purchase our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. in addition, aim receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. unlike the portion of the incentive fee based on net investment income, there is no performance threshold applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. as a result, aim may have a tendency to invest more in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns. the incentive fee payable by us to aim also may create an incentive for aim to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature such as investments with pik provisions. under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would typically not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term or upon the investment being called by the issuer. our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. thus, while a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash and with respect to which we do not have a formal claw-back right against our investment adviser per se, the amount of accrued income to the extent written off in any period will reduce the income in the period in which such write-off was taken and thereby reduce such periods incentive fee payment. we may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such investment companys expenses, including management and performance fees. we will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to aim with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of   22 table of contents other investment companies. with respect to each of these investments, each of our common stockholders will bear his or her share of the management and incentive fee of aim as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which we invest. we may be obligated to pay our investment adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss. our investment adviser is entitled to incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for that quarter (before deducting incentive compensation) above a performance threshold for that quarter. accordingly, since the performance threshold is based on a percentage of our net asset value, decreases in our net asset value make it easier to achieve the performance threshold. our pre-incentive fee net investment income for incentive compensation purposes excludes realized and unrealized capital losses or depreciation that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such capital losses or depreciation result in a net loss on our statement of operations for that quarter. thus, we may be required to pay aim incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net loss for that quarter. our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in u.s. investments. our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in u.s. companies. these risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the united states, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. these risks are likely to be more pronounced for investments in companies located in emerging markets and particularly for middle-market companies in these economies. although most of our investments are denominated in u.s. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to one or more other currencies. among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective. hedging transactions may expose us to additional risks. if we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. we may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. however, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. while we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. in addition, the degree of correlation   23 table of contents between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. in addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-u.s. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. risks related to issuance of our preferred stock an investment in our preferred stock should not constitute a complete investment program. if we issue preferred stock, the net asset value and market value of our common stock may become more volatile. we cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of the common stock. the issuance of preferred stock would likely cause the net asset value and market value of the common stock to become more volatile. if the dividend rate on the preferred stock were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of the common stock would be reduced. if the dividend rate on the preferred stock were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued preferred stock. any decline in the net asset value of our investments would be borne entirely by the holders of common stock. therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. this greater net asset value decrease would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for the common stock. we might be in danger of failing to maintain the required asset coverage of the preferred stock or of losing our ratings on the preferred stock or, in an extreme case, our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the dividend requirements on the preferred stock. in order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund a redemption of some or all of the preferred stock. in addition, we would pay (and the holders of common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, including higher advisory fees if our total return exceeds the dividend rate on the preferred stock. holders of preferred stock may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs. holders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of the board of directors and class voting rights on certain matters. holders of any preferred stock we might issue, voting separately as a single class, would have the right to elect two members of the board of directors at all times and in the event dividends become two full years in arrears would have the right to elect a majority of the directors until such arrearage is completely eliminated. in addition, preferred stockholders have class voting rights on certain matters, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open-end status, and accordingly can veto any such changes. restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies or the terms of our credit facilities, might impair our ability to maintain our qualification as a ric for federal income tax purposes. while we would intend to redeem our preferred stock to the extent necessary to enable us to distribute our income as required to maintain our qualification as a ric, there can be no assurance that such actions could be effected in time to meet the tax requirements.   24 table of contents risks relating to an investment in our common stock investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative. the investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with a low risk tolerance. there is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled. we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. in addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions. if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a ric. in addition, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income in cash to obtain tax benefits as a ric. we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of rics unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending october 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. we will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income taxes (such as retained net capital gains). finally, if more stockholders opt to receive cash dividends rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to liquidate some of our investments and raise cash in order to make cash dividend payments. our shares may trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term. shares of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable to those shares. the possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value will decrease. it is not possible to predict whether shares will trade at, above, or below net asset value. investigations and reviews of affiliate use of placement agents could harm our reputation; depress our stock price or have other negative consequences. while aic has not, to date, raised any funds through the use of placement agents (other than through the ordinary course engagement of underwriters, from time to time, in connection with the public offering of aics securities), affiliates of aim sometimes use placement agents to assist in marketing certain of the investment   25 table of contents funds that they manage. various state attorneys general and regulatory agencies have initiated industry-wide investigations into the use of placement agents in connection with the solicitation of investments, particularly with respect to investments by public pension funds. certain affiliates of agm have received subpoenas and other requests for information from various government regulatory agencies and investors in agms funds, seeking information regarding the use of placement agents. california public employees retirement system (calpers), one of agms strategic investors, announced on october 14, 2009, that it had initiated a special review of placement agents and related issues. agm is cooperating with all such investigations and other reviews. in addition, on may 6, 2010, the california attorney general filed a civil complaint against alfred villalobos and his company, arvco capital research, llc (a placement agent that agm has used), and federico buenrostro jr., the former ceo of calpers, alleging conduct in violation of certain california laws in connection with calpers purchase of securities in various funds managed by agm and another asset manager. no agm entity is a party to the civil lawsuit, and the lawsuit does not allege any misconduct on the part of aic, aim or agm. agm has informed us that it believes it has handled its use of placement agents in an appropriate manner. agm has received requests for information in connection with certain of these investigations and is cooperating with such requests. any unanticipated developments from these or future investigations or changes in industry practice may adversely affect agms business (including with respect to aim) or indirectly thereby, aics business. even if these investigations or changes in industry practice do not directly or indirectly affect agms or aics respective businesses, adverse publicity could harm our reputation and may cause us to lose existing investors, fail to gain new investors, depress our stock price or have other negative consequences. the market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly. the market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. these factors include:        volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of business development companies or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;        changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to rics or business development companies;        loss of ric status;        changes in earnings or variations in operating results;        changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;        any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;        departure of aims key personnel;        operating performance of companies comparable to us;        general economic trends and other external factors; and        loss of a major funding source. we may be unable to invest the net proceeds raised from offerings on acceptable terms, which would harm our financial condition and operating results. until we identify new investment opportunities, we intend to either invest the net proceeds of future offerings in interest-bearing deposits or other short-term instruments or use the net proceeds from such offerings to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility. we cannot assure you that we will be able to find enough appropriate investments that meet our investment criteria or that any investment we complete using the proceeds from an offering will produce a sufficient return.   26 table of contents sales of substantial amounts of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities. if this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan. all dividends declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are generally automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. as a result, stockholders that do not participate in the dividend reinvestment plan may experience dilution over time. stockholders who do not elect to receive dividends in shares of common stock may experience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount. the level of accretion or discount would depend on various factors, including the proportion of our stockholders who participate in the plan, the level of premium or discount at which our shares are trading and the amount of the dividend payable to a stockholder. item 1b. unresolved
