item 1a.    risk factors risk factors         you should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. the risks set out below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. if any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in such case, the value of our common stock and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our relationship with our manager and its affiliates our future success depends on our manager, its key personnel and their access to the investment professionals of ares management. we may not find a suitable replacement for our manager if our management agreement is terminated, or if such key personnel or investment professionals leave the employment of our manager or ares management or otherwise become unavailable to us.         we have no separate facilities and do not have any employees. we rely completely on our manager to provide us with investment advisory services. our executive officers also serve as officers of our manager. our manager has significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. accordingly, we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our manager. the officers and key personnel of our manager evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor our investments; therefore, our success depends on their continued service. the departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our manager could have a material adverse effect on our business.         our manager is not obligated to dedicate any specific personnel exclusively to us. none of our officers are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to our business. each of them has significant responsibilities for other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of ares management. as a result, these individuals may not always be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate markets or distress in the credit markets, the attention of our manager's personnel and our executive officers and the resources of ares management will also be required by other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of ares management.         in addition, we offer no assurance that our manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to our manager's officers and key personnel. the initial term of our management agreement with our manager expires on may 1, 2015, and will be automatically renewed for one-year terms thereafter. furthermore, our manager may decline to renew the management agreement with 180 days' written notice. if the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our investment strategy.         we also depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of key personnel of the ares private debt group and access to the investment professionals of other groups within ares management and the information and deal flow generated by ares management's investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. the departure of any of these individuals, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of ares management, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. we cannot assure you that we will continue to have access to ares management's investment professionals or its information and deal flow. 29 table of contents our growth depends on the ability of our manager to make investments on favorable terms that satisfy our investment strategy and otherwise generate attractive risk-adjusted returns initially and consistently from time to time.         our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on the management and investment teams of our manager and their ability to identify and to make investments on favorable terms in our target investments as well as on our access to financing on acceptable terms. the demands on the time of the professional staff of our manager will increase as our portfolio grows, and we cannot assure you that our manager will be able to hire, train, supervise, manage and retain new officers and employees to manage future growth effectively, and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business. there are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with our manager and ares management that could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.         we are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with our manager and ares management. in the future, we may enter into additional transactions with ares management or its affiliates. in particular, we may invest in, acquire, sell assets to or provide financing to portfolio companies of investment vehicles managed by ares management or its affiliates or co-invest with, purchase assets from, sell assets to, or arrange financing from any such investment vehicles and their portfolio companies. any such transactions will require approval by a majority of our independent directors. there can be no assurance that any procedural protections will be sufficient to ensure that these transactions will be made on terms that will be at least as favorable to us as those that would have been obtained in an arm's length transaction. in addition, to the extent we co-invest with other investment vehicles that are managed by affiliates of ares management, we will not be responsible for fees other than as set forth in our management agreement, except our proportionate share of fees charged by the managers of such other investment vehicles if approved by a majority of our independent directors.         our manager and ares management have agreed that for so long as our manager is managing us, neither ares management nor any of its affiliates will sponsor or manage any other u.s. publicly traded reit that invests primarily in the same asset classes as us. ares management and its affiliates may sponsor or manage another u.s. publicly traded reit that invests generally in real estate assets but not primarily in our target investments.         other than as set forth herein, neither ares management nor any of its affiliates (including our manager) currently manages any other investment vehicle that primarily focuses on our target investments and none of them have any current plans to do so, but they may in the future sponsor or manage other funds or investment vehicles (other than u.s. publicly traded reits) that invest in our target investments. our manager manages certain funds, real estate assets and a collateralized debt obligation, or "cdo," that were previously managed by wrightwood capital llc, or "wrightwood." ares management acquired the investment platform of wrightwood, a provider of debt capital to the u.s. cre sector, in august 2011. none of the wrightwood vehicles will be making any further investments (other than follow-on investments in existing investments and additional fundings pursuant to existing commitments).         ares management has an investment allocation policy in place that is intended to enable us to share equitably with any other investment vehicles that are managed by ares management. in general, investment opportunities are allocated taking into consideration various factors, including, among others, the relevant investment vehicles' available capital, their investment objectives or strategies, their risk profiles and their existing or prior positions in an issuer/security, as well as potential conflicts of interest, the nature of the opportunity and market conditions. the investment allocation policy may be amended by our manager and ares management at any time without our consent. 30 table of contents         certain former wrightwood personnel who are members of the ares commercial real estate group own equity, partnership, profits or other similar interests in wrightwood and certain of its investment vehicles. the ownership of such interests may be viewed as creating a conflict of interest insofar as such persons may receive greater benefits, by virtue of such interests, than they would receive from our manager.         in addition to the fees payable to our manager under the management agreement, our manager and its affiliates may benefit from other fees paid to it in respect of our investments. for example, if we seek to securitize our cre loans, ares management and/or our manager, may act as collateral manager. in any of these or other capacities, ares management and/or our manager may receive market-based fees for their roles, but only if approved by a majority of our independent directors.         as of december 31, 2012, ares investments holdings llc, or "ares investments," an affiliate of our manager, beneficially owned approximately 21.6% of our common stock. to the extent ares investments sells some of these shares, our manager's interests may be less aligned with our interests. in addition, ares investments owns $1,150,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2015 convertible notes. the ability of our manager and its officers and employees to engage in other business activities may reduce the time our manager spends managing our business and may result in certain conflicts of interest.         certain of our officers and directors, and the officers and other personnel of our manager, also serve or may serve as officers, directors or partners of ares management, as well as ares management sponsored investment vehicles, including new affiliated potential pooled investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established, whether managed or sponsored by ares management's affiliates or our manager. accordingly, the ability of our manager and its officers and employees to engage in other business activities may reduce the time our manager spends managing our business. these activities could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest insofar as the time and effort of the professional staff of our manager and its officers and employees will not be devoted exclusively to the business of the company; instead it will be allocated between the business of the company and the management of these other investment vehicles.         in the course of our investing activities, we will pay base management fees to our manager and will reimburse our manager for certain expenses it incurs. as a result, investors in our common stock will invest on a "gross" basis and receive distributions on a "net" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. as a result of this arrangement, our manager's interests may be less aligned with our interests. the management agreement with our manager was not negotiated on an arm's length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.         we do not have any employees and rely completely on our manager to provide us with investment advisory services. our executive officers also serve as officers of our manager. our management agreement with our manager was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.         we will pay our manager substantial base management fees regardless of the performance of our portfolio. our manager's entitlement to a base management fee, which is not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce its incentive to devote its time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. this in turn could hurt both our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. 31 table of contents terminating the management agreement for unsatisfactory performance of the manager or electing not to renew the management agreement may be difficult and terminating the agreement in certain circumstances requires payment of a substantial termination fee.         termination of the management agreement with our manager without cause is difficult and costly. our independent directors will review our manager's performance and the management fees annually and, upon 180 days' written notice prior to the expiration of the initial three-year term that expires on may 1, 2015, or any renewal term, the management agreement may be terminated upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (a) our manager's unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us; or (b) a determination that the management fees payable to our manager are not fair, subject to our manager's right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. additionally, upon any such termination, the management agreement provides that we will pay our manager a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee received by our manager during the prior 24-month period before such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. this provision increases the cost to us of terminating the management agreement and adversely affects our ability to terminate our manager without cause.         during the initial three-year term of the management agreement, we may not terminate the management agreement except for cause. our manager's contractual commitment to manage us is limited to the initial three-year term of the management agreement.         our manager is only contractually committed to serve us until may 1, 2015. thereafter, the management agreement automatically renews for one-year terms; provided, however, that our manager may terminate the management agreement upon 180 days' written notice prior to the expiration of the initial three-year term or any renewal term. if the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our investment strategy. the incentive fee payable to our manager under the management agreement may cause our manager to select investments in riskier assets to increase its incentive compensation.         our manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of core earnings (see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsnon-gaap financial measures" for the definition of core earnings and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings). in evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on core earnings may lead our manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of core earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. this could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio. our manager manages our portfolio in accordance with very broad investment guidelines and our board of directors does not approve each investment and financing decision made by our manager, which may result in our making riskier investments than those currently comprising our investment portfolio.         while our directors periodically review our investment portfolio, they do not review all of our proposed investments. in addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by our manager. our investment guidelines may be changed from time to time. furthermore, our manager may use complex strategies and transactions entered into by our 32 table of contents manager that may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our directors. our manager has great latitude in determining the types of assets that are proper investments for us, which could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business operations and results. in addition, our manager is not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we originate or acquire other than as necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and our exemption from registration under the 1940 act. decisions made and investments entered into by our manager may not fully reflect your best interests. our manager may change its investment process, or elect not to follow it, without stockholder consent at any time, which may adversely affect our investments.         our manager may change its investment process without stockholder consent at any time. in addition, there can be no assurance that our manager will follow its investment process in relation to the identification and underwriting of prospective investments. changes in our manager's investment process may result in inferior, among other things, due diligence and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect the performance of our portfolio. we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us.         we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. however, our code of business conduct and ethics contains a conflicts of interest policy that prohibits our directors, officers and employees from engaging in any transaction that involves an actual conflict of interest with us without the approval of the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, our management agreement with our manager does not prevent our manager and its affiliates from engaging in additional management or investment opportunities, some of which could compete with us, and our code of business conduct and ethics acknowledges that such activities shall not be deemed a conflict of interest. our manager is subject to extensive regulation as an investment adviser, which could adversely affect its ability to manage our business.         our manager is subject to regulation as an investment adviser by various regulatory authorities that are charged with protecting the interests of its clients, including us. instances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the investment management industry and disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry have led the u.s. government and regulators to consider increasing the rules and regulations governing, and oversight of, the u.s. financial system. this activity is expected to result in changes to the laws and regulations governing the investment management industry and more aggressive enforcement of the existing laws and regulations. our manager could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanction, including revocation of its registration as an investment adviser, revocation of the licenses of its employees, censures, fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if it is found to have violated any of these laws or regulations. any such liability or sanction could adversely affect our manager's ability to manage our business. our manager must continually address conflicts between its interests and those of its clients, including us. in addition, the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. our manager has procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to address these issues. however, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and if our manager fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, it could face litigation or regulatory proceedings or penalties, any of which could adversely affect its ability to manage our business. 33 table of contents we may not replicate ares management's historical performance.         we cannot assure you that we will replicate ares management's historical performance, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by other entities managed by ares management or its affiliates. although such funds share our general objective of targeting investments in senior secured debt, each of them is or has been focused on making senior debt investments secured primarily by the corporate assets of their borrowers and none of them target investments in senior or any other loans secured by cre, which is our specific investment objective. we do not own the ares name, but we may use the name pursuant to a license agreement with ares management. use of the name by other parties or the termination of our license agreement may harm our business.         we have entered into a license agreement with ares management pursuant to which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "ares." under this agreement, we have a right to use this name for so long as ares commercial real estate management llc serves as our manager pursuant to the management agreement. ares management retains the right to continue using the "ares" name. we cannot preclude ares management from licensing or transferring the ownership of the "ares" name to third parties, some of whom may compete with us. consequently, we would be unable to prevent any damage to goodwill that may occur as a result of the activities of ares management or others. furthermore, in the event that the license agreement is terminated, we will be required to change our name and cease using the name. any of these events could disrupt our recognition in the market place, damage any goodwill we may have generated and otherwise harm our business. the license agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 180 days written notice to the other. our manager's and ares management's liability is limited under the management agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our manager against certain liabilities. as a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which our manager would not be liable.         pursuant to the management agreement, our manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and will not be responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. under the terms of the management agreement, our manager, its officers, members, managers, directors, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our manager, including ares management, and any person providing services to our manager will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our stockholders or partners or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement, except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the management agreement. in addition, we have agreed to indemnify our manager, its officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our manager and any person providing services to our manager with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts of our manager not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement. our manager and its affiliates, including ares management, have limited experience managing a portfolio of assets in the manner necessary to maintain our exemption under the 1940 act.         in order to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 act, the assets in our portfolio are subject to certain restrictions that limit our operations meaningfully. our manager and its affiliates, including ares management, have limited experience managing a portfolio in the manner necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 act. 34 table of contents risks related to our company we have limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders.         we were organized on september 1, 2011, completed our ipo on may 1, 2012 and have limited operating history. we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and strategies as described in this annual report. the results of our operations depend on several factors, including the availability of opportunities for the origination or acquisition of target investments, the level and volatility of interest rates, the availability of adequate short and long-term financing, conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions. in addition, our future operating results and financial data may vary materially from the historical operating results and financial data contained in this annual report because of a number of factors, including costs and expenses associated with the management agreement and being a public company. consequently, the historical financial statements contained in this annual report may not be useful in assessing our likely future performance. we have experienced losses in the past and may experience similar losses in the future.         we incurred net operating losses for the period from september 1, 2011 (inception) to december 31, 2011. these losses have been incurred primarily because we have been in the initial stages of building our investment portfolio. as a result, our earnings have been highly sensitive to a number of variables, including the velocity and timing of new originations and our level of operating expenses. our operating costs to date have been primarily funded with offering proceeds. we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future or that our target investments will produce sufficient income to fund our operating expenses and dividends. our board of directors may change our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies without stockholder consent.         our board of directors may change our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to investments, originations, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile than that of our current investment portfolio or of a portfolio comprised of our target investments. a change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations. furthermore, a change in our asset allocation could result in our making investments in asset categories different from those described in this annual report. these changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations (including, without limitation, laws and regulations having the effect of exempting mortgage reits from the 1940 act) and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business.         we are subject to regulation by laws and regulations at the local, state and federal. these laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with current or new laws or regulations or such changes thereto, could require changes to certain of our business practices, 35 table of contents negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. furthermore, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. in general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price. actions of the u.s. government, including the u.s. congress, federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies, to stabilize or reform the financial markets, or market response to those actions, may not achieve the intended effect and may adversely affect our business.         in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions, the emergency economic stabilization act, or "eesa," was enacted by the u.s. congress in 2008. there can be no assurance that the eesa or any other u.s. government actions will have a beneficial impact on the financial markets. to the extent the markets do not respond favorably to any such actions by the u.s. government or such actions do not function as intended, our business may not receive the anticipated positive impact from the legislation and such result may have broad adverse market implications.         in july 2010, the u.s. congress enacted the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, or the "dodd-frank act," in part to impose significant investment restrictions and capital requirements on banking entities and other organizations that are significant to u.s. financial markets. for instance, the dodd-frank act will impose significant restrictions on the proprietary trading activities of certain banking entities and subject other systemically significant organizations regulated by the u.s. federal reserve to increased capital requirements and quantitative limits for engaging in such activities. the dodd-frank act also seeks to reform the asset-backed securitization market (including the mortgage-backed securities market) by requiring the retention of a portion of the credit risk inherent in the pool of securitized assets and by imposing additional registration and disclosure requirements. while the full impact of the dodd-frank act cannot be assessed until all implementing regulations are released, the dodd-frank act's extensive requirements may have a significant effect on the financial markets, and may affect the availability or terms of financing from our lender counterparties and the availability or terms of mortgage-backed securities, both of which may have an adverse effect on our business.         in addition, the u.s. government, federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what effect, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the downgrade of the u.s. credit rating and the economic crisis in europe could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.         the ongoing u.s. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, together with signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe, have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the u.s. although u.s. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling in august 2011, standard & poor's ratings services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the united states from "aaa" to "aa." the impact of this or any further downgrades to the u.s. government's sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the u.s. and global financial markets and economic conditions. further, moody's investors service has warned that it may downgrade the u.s. federal government's rating if the federal debt is not stabilized. absent further quantitative easing by the federal reserve, these developments, along with the european sovereign debt crisis, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable 36 table of contents terms. continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.         our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems of ares management. any failure or interruption of ares management's systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. risks related to sources of financing and hedging we may incur significant additional debt, which may subject us to restrictive covenants and increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders.         we borrow funds under the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility and the capital one facility. subject to market conditions and availability, we may incur significant additional debt through bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and structured financing arrangements, public and private debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements. the percentage of leverage we employ will vary depending on our available capital, our ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders, debt restrictions contained in those financing arrangements and the lenders' and rating agencies' estimate of the stability of our investment portfolio's cash flow. we may significantly increase the amount of leverage we utilize at any time without approval of our board of directors. in addition, we may leverage individual assets at substantially higher levels. incurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that:  our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (a) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (b) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements, and/or (c) the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale;  our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment yields will increase with higher financing costs;  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, stockholder distributions or other purposes; and  we are not able to refinance debt that matures prior to the investment it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all.         there can be no assurance that our leveraging strategy will be successful. 37 table of contents our secured funding facilities impose, and any additional lending facilities will impose, restrictive covenants.         we borrow funds under the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility and the capital one facility. the documents that govern these secured funding facilities contain, and any additional lending facilities would be expected to contain, customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants, that among other things, may affect our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments or acquisitions, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem debt or equity securities and impact our flexibility to determine our operating policies and investment strategies. for example, such loan documents contain negative covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to repurchase our common stock, distribute more than a certain amount of our net income or funds from operations to our stockholders, employ leverage beyond certain amounts, sell assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens, and enter into transactions with affiliates (including amending the management agreement with our manager in a material respect). certain of the restrictive covenants that apply to the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility and the capital one facility are further described in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssecured funding arrangements." if we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. we are also subject to cross-default and acceleration rights and, with respect to collateralized debt, the posting of additional collateral and foreclosure rights upon default. further, these restrictions could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the qualification requirements necessary to maintain our status as a reit. interest rate fluctuations could increase our financing costs and reduce our ability to generate income on our investments, each of which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments.         our primary interest rate exposures will relate to the yield on our investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as our interest rate swaps that we utilize for hedging purposes. changes in interest rates will affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses for us. changes in the level of interest rates also may affect our ability to invest in investments, the value of our investments and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets. changes in interest rates may also affect borrower default rates.         to the extent that our financing costs will be determined by reference to floating rates, such as libor or a treasury index, plus a margin, the amount of such costs will depend on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, (a) for collateralized debt, the value and liquidity of the collateral, and for non-collateralized debt, our credit, (b) the level and movement of interest rates, and (c) general market conditions and liquidity. in a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense on floating rate debt would increase, while any additional interest income we earn on our floating rate investments may be subject to caps and may not compensate for such increase in interest expense. at the same time, the interest income we earn on our fixed rate investments would not change, the duration and weighted average life of our fixed rate investments would increase and the market value of our fixed rate investments would decrease. similarly, in a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on floating rate investments would decrease, while any decrease in the interest we are charged on our floating rate debt may be subject to floors and not compensate for such decrease in interest income. additionally, the interest we are charged on our fixed rate debt would not change. any such scenario could materially and adversely affect us. 38 table of contents         our operating results will depend, in part, on differences between the income earned on our investments, net of credit losses, and our financing costs. for any period during which our investments are not match-funded, the income earned on such investments may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may immediately and significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments. the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility, the capital one facility and any bank credit facilities and repurchase agreements that we may use in the future to finance our assets, may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt.         we borrow funds under the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility and the capital one facility. we anticipate that we will also utilize additional bank credit facilities or repurchase agreements (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our assets if they become available on acceptable terms. such financing arrangements would involve the risk that the value of the loans pledged or sold by us to the provider of the bank credit facility or repurchase agreement counterparty may decline in value, in which case the lender may require us to provide additional collateral or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. we may not have the funds available to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. posting additional collateral would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets. if we cannot meet these requirements, the lender could accelerate our indebtedness, increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from it, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy. in addition, if the lender files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our loans may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the benefit of these assets. such an event could restrict our access to bank credit facilities and increase our cost of capital. the providers of bank credit facilities and repurchase agreement financing may also require us to maintain a certain amount of cash or set aside assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position that would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. as a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on assets. if we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition and prospects could deteriorate rapidly.         in addition, if a counterparty to our repurchase transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of that term, or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement, we will likely incur a loss on our repurchase transactions.         there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional bank credit facilities or repurchase agreements on favorable terms, or at all. our access to sources of financing may be limited and thus our ability to grow our business and to maximize our returns may be adversely affected.         we borrow funds under the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility and the capital one facility. subject to market conditions and availability, we may incur significant additional debt through bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and structured financing arrangements, public and private debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements. we may also issue additional debt or equity securities to fund our growth. 39 table of contents         our access to sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which we have little or no control, including:  general economic or market conditions;  the market's view of the quality of our assets;  the market's perception of our growth potential;  our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and  the market price of the shares of our common stock.         we will need to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments in excess of our repayments. we intend to elect to be treated as a reit and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the u.s. federal income tax treatment applicable to reits. among other things, in order to maintain our reit status, we are generally required to annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our reit taxable income, and, as a result, such distributions will not be available to fund investment originations. we must continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional securities to fund the growth of our investments. unfavorable economic or capital market conditions, such as the severe economic downturn that began in 2007, may increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or could result in a decision by our potential lenders not to extend credit. an inability to successfully access the capital markets could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and could decrease our earnings, if any. in addition, the current dislocation and weakness in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect one or more private lenders and could cause one or more of our private lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. in addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. in general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price. no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any such financing, including any replacement of the wells fargo facility, the citibank facility or the capital one facility on favorable terms or at all. any warehouse facilities that we may obtain in the future may limit our ability to originate or acquire assets, and we may incur losses if the collateral is liquidated.         if securitization financings become available, we may utilize, if available, warehouse facilities pursuant to which we would accumulate mortgage loans in anticipation of a securitization financing, which assets would be pledged as collateral for such facilities until the securitization transaction is consummated. in order to borrow funds to originate or acquire assets under any future warehouse facilities, we expect that our lenders thereunder would have the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing. we may be unable to obtain the consent of a lender to originate or acquire assets that we believe would be beneficial to us and we may be unable to obtain alternate financing for such assets. in addition, no assurance can be given that a securitization structure would be consummated with respect to the assets being warehoused. if the securitization is not consummated, the lender could demand repayment of the facility, and in the event that we were unable to timely repay, could liquidate the warehoused collateral and we would then have to pay any amount by which the original purchase price of the collateral assets exceeds its sale price, subject to negotiated caps, if any, on our exposure. in addition, regardless of whether the securitization is consummated, if any of the warehoused collateral is sold before the completion, we would have to bear any resulting loss on the sale. 40 table of contents if non-recourse long-term securitizations become available to us in the future, such structures may expose us to risks which could result in losses.         if available, we may utilize non-recourse long-term securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans, especially loan originations, if and when they become available. prior to any such financing, we may seek to finance these investments with relatively short-term facilities until a sufficient portfolio is accumulated. as a result, we would be subject to the risk that we would not be able to originate or acquire, during the period that any short-term facilities are available, sufficient eligible assets to maximize the efficiency of a securitization. we also would bear the risk that we would not be able to obtain new short-term facilities or would not be able to renew any short-term facilities after they expire should we need more time to seek and originate or acquire sufficient eligible assets for a securitization. in addition, conditions in the capital markets, including volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, may not permit a non-recourse securitization at any particular time or may make the issuance of any such securitization less attractive to us even when we do have sufficient eligible assets. while we would intend to retain the unrated equity component of securitizations and, therefore, still have exposure to any investments included in such securitizations, our inability to enter into such securitizations would increase our overall exposure to risks associated with direct ownership of such investments, including the risk of default. our inability to refinance any short-term facilities would also increase our risk because borrowings thereunder would likely be recourse to us as an entity. if we are unable to obtain and renew short-term facilities or to consummate securitizations to finance our investments on a long-term basis, we may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price. we may enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future.         subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit, part of our investment strategy will involve entering into hedging transactions that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (such as the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument). the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. these economic losses will be reflected in our results of operations, and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition. hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.         subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit, we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. this hedging activity may vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, the type of assets held and other changing market conditions. interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:  interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;  available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;  due to a credit loss, the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability; 41 table of contents  the amount of income that a reit may earn from hedging transactions (other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain requirements of the code or that are done through a trs to offset interest rate losses is limited by u.s. federal income tax provisions governing reits;  the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and  the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.         in addition, we may fail to recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient manner. any hedging activity in which we engage may materially and adversely affect our business. therefore, while we may enter into such transactions seeking to reduce interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. in addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged. any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses.         the cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates, we may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs. in addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house. consequently, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. the business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in its default. default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our commitments, if any, at the then current market price. although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in significant losses. changes to derivatives regulation imposed by the dodd-frank act could increase our costs of entering into derivative transactions, which could adversely impact our results of operation, financial condition and business.         through its comprehensive new regulatory regime for derivatives, the dodd-frank act will impose mandatory clearing, exchange-trading and margin requirements on many derivatives transactions (including formerly unregulated over the-counter derivatives) in which we may engage. the dodd-frank act also creates new categories of regulated market participants, such as "swap dealers," "security-based swap dealers," "major swap participants," and "major security-based swap participants" that will be subject to significant new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business 42 table of contents conduct and other regulatory requirements. the details of these requirements and the parameters of these categories remain to be clarified through rulemaking and interpretations by the u.s. commodity futures trading commission, or the "cftc," the sec, the federal reserve board and other regulators in a regulatory implementation process which is expected to take a year or more to complete.         nonetheless, based on information available as of the date of this annual report, the possible effect of the dodd-frank act will be likely to increase our overall costs of entering into derivatives transactions. in particular, new margin requirements, position limits and capital charges, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivatives transactions sold by market participants to whom such requirements apply. administrative costs, due to new requirements such as registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance, even if not directly applicable to us, may also be reflected in higher pricing of derivatives. new exchange-trading and trade reporting requirements may lead to reductions in the liquidity of derivative transactions, causing higher pricing or reduced availability of derivatives, or the reduction of arbitrage opportunities for us, adversely affecting the performance of certain of our trading strategies.         in addition, it is possible that the company may be determined by a governmental authority to be a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant or otherwise become subject to new entity and transaction level regulation as a result of the dodd-frank act. this additional regulation could lead to significant new costs which could materially adversely affect our business. we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.         we intend to record derivative and hedging transactions in accordance with financial accounting standards board, or "fasb," asc 815, derivatives and hedging. under these standards, we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons, including if we use instruments that do not meet the fasb asc 815 definition of a derivative (such as short sales), we fail to satisfy fasb asc 815 hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or our instruments are not highly effective. if we fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, our operating results may suffer because losses on the derivatives that we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction or item. we may enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future.         subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit, we may enter into derivative contracts that could require us to fund cash payments in the future under certain circumstances (e.g., the early termination of the derivative agreement caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the derivative contract). the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. these economic losses may materially and adversely affect our business. we are currently exempt from being regulated as a commodity pool operator in part because we comply with certain restrictions regarding our use of certain derivative instruments, and failure to comply with such restrictions could subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.         recently adopted rules under the dodd-frank act establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivative contracts commonly referred to as "swaps." under these recently adopted rules, any investment fund that trades in swaps may be considered a "commodity pool," which would cause its directors to be regulated as "commodity pool operators," or "cpos." unless an exemption is 43 table of contents available, a cpo must register with the cftc and become a member of the national futures association, or the "nfa," which requires compliance with nfa's rules, and renders such cpo subject to regulation by the cftc, including with respect to disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct.         we do not currently invest in any instruments that meet the definition of "swap" under the new rules, and we do not currently expect to engage in any speculative derivatives activities or other non-hedging transactions using swaps, futures or options on futures. however, we may use hedging instruments in conjunction with our investment portfolio and related borrowings to reduce or mitigate risks associated with changes in interest rates, mortgage spreads, yield curve shapes and market volatility. these hedging instruments could include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures and options on interest rate futures, each of which is considered a "swap" under cftc rules. we have submitted a claim for relief from any registration requirements pursuant to a no-action letter issued by the cftc for mortgage reits. in order to qualify for relief from registration, we are restricted to using swaps within certain specific parameters, including a limitation that our annual income derived from commodity interest trading be less than 5% of our gross annual income and that the initial margin and premiums required to establish commodity interest positions be no more than 5 percent of the fair market value of our total assets. if we fail to comply with the applicable restrictions, our directors may be compelled to register as cpos, or we may be required to seek other hedging instruments or techniques at increased cost to us, or that may not be as effective as the use of swaps. risks related to our investments we will allocate our available capital without input from our stockholders.         you will not be able to evaluate the manner in which our available capital is invested or the economic merit of our expected investments. as a result, we may use our available capital to invest in investments with which you may not agree. additionally, our investments will be selected by our manager and our stockholders will not have input into such investment decisions. both of these factors will increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our securities. the failure of our manager to apply this capital effectively or find investments that meet our investment criteria in sufficient time or on acceptable terms could result in unfavorable returns, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and could cause the value of our common stock to decline.         until appropriate investments can be identified, our manager may invest our available capital in interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts or funds, cmbs or corporate bonds, which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit. these investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we seek to achieve from investments in our target investments. our manager intends to conduct due diligence with respect to each investment and suitable investment opportunities may not be immediately available. even if opportunities are available, there can be no assurance that our manager's due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful.         we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into definitive agreements to invest in any new investments that meet our investment objective; that we will be successful in consummating any investment opportunities we identify; or that one or more investments we may make will yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. our inability to do any of the foregoing likely would materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 44 table of contents the lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.         the illiquidity of our target investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. certain target investments such as b-notes, transitional, mezzanine and other loans are also particularly illiquid investments due to their short life, their potential unsuitability for securitization and the greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower's default. in addition, many of the loans and securities we invest in will not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or otherwise in accordance with, those laws. as a result, we expect many of our investments will be illiquid, and if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded investments. further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we or our manager has or could be attributed as having material, non-public information regarding such business entity. as a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of loans, which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if any of these loans default.         as of december 31, 2012, we were invested in 15 loans. the number of loans we are invested in may be higher or lower depending on the amount of our assets under management at any given time, market conditions and the extent to which we employ leverage, and will likely fluctuate over time. a consequence of this limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly, if we need to write down the value of any one investment or if an investment is repaid prior to maturity and we are not able to promptly redeploy the proceeds. we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few loans.         while we intend to continue to diversify our portfolio of investments in the manner described in our filings with the sec, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification. as a result our investments could be concentrated in relatively few loans and/or relatively few property types. if our portfolio of target investments is concentrated in certain property types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure, or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our investments within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our common stock and accordingly reduce our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. a prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or further declines in real estate values could impair our investments and harm our operations.         we believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if these periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. for example, the severe economic downturn that began in 2007 continues to limit the availability of debt financing in the overall marketplace and has generally made leveraged acquisitions and refinancing more difficult. consequently, our investment model may be adversely affected if the current economic conditions persist for longer than we may anticipate. declining real estate values would likely reduce the level of new mortgage and other real estate-related loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans if the value of real estate weakens. further, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan. any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or 45 table of contents losses could adversely affect our manager's ability to invest in, sell and securitize loans, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. our real estate investments are subject to risks particular to real property. these risks may result in a reduction or elimination of, or return from, a loan secured by a particular property.         we may own cre directly in the future as a result of a default of mortgage or other real estate related loans. real estate investments are subject to various risks, including:  acts of god, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses;  acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks;  adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;  changes in governmental laws and regulations (including their interpretations), fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;  costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as indoor mold; and  the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses.         if any of these or similar events occurs, it may reduce our return from an affected property or investment and reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. the senior cre loans we originate and the mortgage loans underlying any cmbs investments that we may make will be subject to the ability of the commercial property owner to generate net income from operating the property, as well as the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.         our senior cre loans are secured by commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that may be greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of single-family residential property. the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. if the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. net operating income of an income-producing property can be adversely affected by, among other things,  tenant mix;  success of tenant businesses;  property management decisions;  property location, condition and design;  competition from comparable types of properties;  changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;  changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, including the credit and securitization markets;  declines in regional or local real estate values;  declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; 46 table of contents  increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;  costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions;  the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses;  changes in governmental laws and regulations, including fiscal policies, zoning ordinances and environmental legislation and the related costs of compliance; and  acts of god, terrorist attacks, social unrest and civil disturbances.         in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan. we operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities.         a number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we seek to make. our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate or acquire our target investments on attractive terms. in originating or acquiring our target investments, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other reits, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by ares management), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. several other reits have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the u.s. government. many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with reit tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 act. in addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, deploy more aggressive pricing and establish more relationships than us. furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in our target investments may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. we cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, as a result of this competition, desirable investments in our target investments may be limited in the future and we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, as we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 47 table of contents if our manager overestimates the yields or incorrectly prices the risks of our investments, we may experience losses.         our manager values our potential investments based on yields and risks, taking into account estimated future losses on the mortgage loans and the collateral underlying them, and the estimated impact of these losses on expected future cash flows and returns. our manager's loss estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. if our manager underestimates the asset-level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment. loans on properties in transition will involve a greater risk of loss than traditional investment-grade mortgage loans with fully insured borrowers.         we may originate transitional loans secured by first lien mortgages on a property to borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition or rehabilitation of a property. the typical borrower under a transitional loan has usually identified an undervalued asset that has been under-managed and/or is located in a recovering market. if the market in which the asset is located fails to improve according to the borrower's projections, or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset's management and/or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the transitional loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our investment.         in addition, borrowers usually use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a transitional loan. transitional loans therefore are subject to risks of a borrower's inability to obtain permanent financing to repay the transitional loan. transitional loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance. in the event of any default under transitional loans that may be held by us, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the transitional loan. to the extent we suffer such losses with respect to these transitional loans, the value of the company and the price of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected. risks of cost overruns and noncompletion of renovation of the properties underlying short term senior loans on properties in transition may result in significant losses.         the renovation, refurbishment or expansion by a borrower under a mortgaged property involves risks of cost overruns and noncompletion. estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property may prove inaccurate. other risks may include rehabilitation costs exceeding original estimates, possibly making a project uneconomical, environmental risks and rehabilitation and subsequent leasing of the property not being completed on schedule. if such renovation is not completed in a timely manner, or if it costs more than expected, the borrower may experience a prolonged impairment of net operating income and may not be able to make payments on our investment, which could result in significant losses. investments in non-conforming and non-investment grade rated loans or securities involve increased risk of loss.         many of our investments will not conform to conventional loan standards applied by traditional lenders and either will not be rated or will be rated as non-investment grade by the rating agencies. the non-investment grade ratings for these assets typically result from the overall leverage of the loans, the lack of a strong operating history for the properties underlying the loans, the borrowers' credit history, the underlying properties' cash flow or other factors. as a result, these investments should be expected to have a higher risk of default and loss than investment grade rated assets. any loss we incur 48 table of contents may be significant and may reduce distributions to our stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock. there are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non-investment grade rated assets we may hold in our investment portfolio. the b-notes that we have originated or may originate or acquire in the future may be subject to additional risks related to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the transaction, which may result in losses to us.         we have originated and may continue to originate or acquire b-notes. a b-note is a mortgage loan typically (a) secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties and (b) subordinated to an a-note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral. as a result, if a borrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for b-note holders after payment to the a-note holders. because each transaction is privately negotiated, b-notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks. for example, the rights of holders of b-notes to control the process following a borrower default may vary from transaction to transaction. further, b-notes typically are secured by a single property and accordingly reflect the risks associated with significant concentration. significant losses related to our b-notes would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. our mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties.         we have originated and may continue to originate or acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. these types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. any credit ratings assigned to our investments will be subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded.         some of our investments may be rated by rating agencies such as moody's investors service, fitch ratings, standard & poor's, dbrs, inc. or realpoint llc. any credit ratings on our investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. if rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of our investments could significantly decline, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. 49 table of contents we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets.         a decline in the fair market value of our assets may require us to recognize an "other-than-temporary" impairment against such assets under gaap, if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the original acquisition cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we experience a decline in the fair value of our assets, our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. some of our portfolio investments may be recorded at fair value and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments.         some of our portfolio investments may be in the form of positions or securities that are not publicly traded. the fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. currently, the only financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the company's consolidated financial statements are derivative instruments. the company has not elected the fair value option for the remaining financial instruments, including loans held for investment and secured funding agreements. such financial instruments are carried at cost. for loans held for investment that are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly, we estimate the fair value of the instrument, which may include unobservable inputs. because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. the value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.         additionally, the company's results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that the company ultimately realizes upon their disposal. the valuation process has been particularly challenging recently, as market events have made valuations of certain assets more difficult, unpredictable and volatile. if we invest in cmbs, such investments would pose additional risks, including the risks of the securitization process and the risk that the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interests.         we may acquire cmbs. in general, losses on a mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan included in a securitization will be borne first by the equity holder of the property, then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit, if any, then by the holder of a mezzanine loan or b-note, if any, then by the "first loss" subordinated stockholder (generally, the "b-piece" buyer) and then by the holder of a higher-rated security. in the event of default and the exhaustion of any equity support, reserve fund, letter of credit, mezzanine loans or b-notes, and any classes of securities junior to those in which we invest, we will not be able to recover all of our investment in the securities we purchase. in addition, if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued by the originator, or if the values subsequently decline and, as a result, less collateral value is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related mortgage-backed securities. the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated investments, but more sensitive to adverse economic downturns or individual issuer developments. 50 table of contents         with respect to the cmbs in which we may invest, overall control over the special servicing of the related underlying mortgage loans will be held by a "directing certificateholder" or a "controlling class representative," which is appointed by the holders of the most subordinated class of cmbs in such series. because we may acquire classes of existing series of cmbs, we will not have the right to appoint the directing certificateholder. in connection with the servicing of the specially serviced mortgage loans, the related special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificateholder, take actions with respect to the specially serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect our interests. insurance on mortgage loans and real estate securities collateral may not cover all losses.         there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, also might result in insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds received with respect to a property relating one of our investments might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to our investment. any uninsured loss could result in the loss of cash flow from, and the asset value of, the affected property and the value of our investment related to such property. liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire upon foreclosure of the properties underlying our investments.         to the extent we foreclose on properties with respect to which we have extended mortgage loans, we may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from such foreclosed properties. under various u.s. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.         the presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner's ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. to the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt investments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.         if we foreclose on any properties underlying our investments, the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. the discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.         our common stock is listed on the nyse under the trading symbol "acre." over the past several years, the global capital and credit markets have been in an extended period of volatility and disruption. the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. 51 table of contents         some of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock include:  our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, or changes in business strategy or prospects;  actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our manager or ares management and individuals, including our executives;  equity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;  loss of a major funding source;  actual or anticipated accounting problems;  publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;  changes in market valuations of similar companies;  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future;  additions to or departures of our manager's or ares management's key personnel;  speculation in the press or investment community;  increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common stock, if we have begun to make distributions to our stockholders, and would result in increased interest expenses on our debt;  failure to maintain our reit qualification or exemption from the 1940 act;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  general market and economic conditions, and trends including inflationary concerns, the current state of the credit and capital markets;  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of publicly traded reits or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;  changes in law, regulatory policies or tax guidelines, or interpretations thereof, particularly with respect to reits;  changes in the value of our portfolio;  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;  operating performance of companies comparable to us;  short-selling pressure with respect to shares of our common stock or reits generally;  uncertainty surrounding the strength of the u.s. economic recovery particularly in light of the recent downgrade of the u.s. government's credit rating; and  concerns regarding european sovereign debt.         as noted above, market factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. as a result, interest 52 table of contents rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets can affect the market value of our common stock. for instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase. common stock eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.         as of december 31, 2012, we had 9,267,162 shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. of these shares, 7,700,000 shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction or limitation under the securities act.         prior to our ipo, there was no established trading market for our common stock. we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common stock. the market price of our common stock may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by certain of our stockholders lapse. sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.         we may issue additional restricted common stock and other equity-based awards under our 2012 equity incentive plan. we may continue to issue additional shares in subsequent public offerings or private placements to make new investments or for other purposes. we are not required to offer any such shares to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. therefore, it may not be possible for existing stockholders to participate in such future share issuances, which may dilute the existing stockholders' interests in us. we have not established a minimum distribution payment level and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future.         we are generally required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with gaap), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, for us to qualify as a reit, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. we have not established a minimum distribution payment level and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this annual report. all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt covenants, maintenance of our reit qualification and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. we believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders:  our ability to make profitable investments;  margin calls or other expenses that reduce our cash flow;  defaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio; and  the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.         as a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future or that the level of any distributions we do make to our stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. 53 table of contents         in addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes), and not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, generally will be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. however, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as capital gain dividends and generally will be taxed to our stockholders as long-term capital gain to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the stockholder that receives such distribution has held its stock. distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, may constitute a return of capital. a return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock, but not below zero. our distributions may exceed our cash flow from our operations and our earnings.         we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. the regular quarterly cash distributions we pay are expected to be principally sourced by cash flow from operating activities. however, there can be no assurance that our earnings or cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to cover our future distributions, and we may use other sources of funds, such as from offering proceeds, borrowings and asset sales, to fund portions of our future distributions. our distributions for the year ended december 31, 2012 exceeded, and future distributions may exceed, our cash flow from operating activities and earnings primarily because we have been in the initial stages of building our investment portfolio and as a result our earnings have been highly sensitive to a number of variables, including the velocity and timing of new originations and our level of operating expenses. such distributions reduce the amount of cash we have available for investing and other purposes and could be dilutive to our financial results. investing in our common stock may involve a high degree of risk.         the investments that we make in accordance with our investment objectives may result in a high amount of risk when compared to alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. our investments may be highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance. future offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.         if we decide to issue debt or equity securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. we and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us. the interests of certain control persons may be adverse to investors.         our board of directors has established an excepted holder limit for ares investments that allows ares investments to own, subject to certain conditions, up to 22% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. as of december 31, 2012, ares investments owned 2,000,000 shares, or 21.6%, of our total shares of common stock outstanding. in addition, ares investments owns $1,150,000 aggregate 54 table of contents principal amount of the 2015 convertible notes. this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive a disadvantage in owning shares in a company with only one or very few controlling stockholders. furthermore, ares investments has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if such a change of control would benefit you. our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of the 2015 convertible notes.         our 2015 convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning on june 15, 2015 or, under certain circumstances, earlier. upon conversion of the 2015 convertible notes, we have the choice to pay or deliver, as the case may be, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. the current conversion price of the 2015 convertible notes is approximately $18.65 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. if we elect to deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our tangible book value per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time, our stockholders may incur dilution. in addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2015 convertible notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance. we are an "emerging growth company" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.         we are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the jobs act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies," including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. risks related to our organization and structure the maryland general corporation law, or the "mgcl," prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.         under the mgcl, "business combinations" between a maryland corporation and an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. these business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. an interested stockholder is defined as: (a) any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or (b) an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation. 55 table of contents         a person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. however, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.         after the expiration of the five-year period described above, any business combination between the maryland corporation and an interested stockholder must generally be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:  80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and  two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation, other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected, or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.         these supermajority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the mgcl, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. the mgcl also permits various exemptions from these provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination with ares investments or any of its affiliates. consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and ares investments or any of its affiliates. as a result, ares investments or any of its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. the business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations.         our board of directors determines our major policies, including with regard to financing, growth, debt capitalization, reit qualification and distributions. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. under our charter and the mgcl, our stockholders generally have a right to vote only on the following matters:  the election or removal of directors;  the amendment of our charter, except that our board of directors may amend our charter without stockholder approval to:  change our name;  change the name or other designation or the par value of any class or series of stock and the aggregate par value of our stock;  increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock that we have the authority to issue;  increase or decrease the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we have the authority to issue; and  effect certain reverse stock splits;  our liquidation and dissolution; and 56 table of contents  our being a party to a merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or statutory share exchange.         all other matters are subject to the discretion of our board of directors. our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control.         our charter authorizes us to issue up to 450,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. in addition, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. as a result, our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a merger, third-party tender offer or similar transaction or a change in incumbent management that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. maintenance of our exemption from registration under the 1940 act imposes significant limits on our operations. your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 act.         we intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 act. we believe we will not be considered an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(a) of the 1940 act because we will not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. however, under section 3(a)(1)(c) of the 1940 act, because we are a holding company that will conduct its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries, the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of "investment company" under section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries. in addition, the assets we and our subsidiaries may originate or acquire are limited by the provisions of the 1940 act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940 act, which may adversely affect our business.         if the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of "investment company" by section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company or (b) to register as an investment company under the 1940 act, either of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. if we or any of our subsidiaries were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to capital structure (including the ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. 57 table of contents         failure to maintain an exemption would require us to significantly restructure our investment strategy. for example, because affiliate transactions are generally prohibited under the 1940 act, we would not be able to enter into transactions with any of our affiliates if we are required to register as an investment company, and we might be required to terminate our management agreement and any other agreements with affiliates, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and pay distributions. if we were required to register us as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. in addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.         we expect certain subsidiaries that we may form in the future to rely upon the exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 act pursuant to section 3(c)(5)(c) of the 1940 act, which is available for entities "primarily engaged" in the business of "purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate." this exemption generally requires that at least 55% of these subsidiaries' assets must comprise qualifying real estate assets and at least 80% of each of their portfolios must comprise qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets under the 1940 act. we expect each of our subsidiaries relying on section 3(c)(5)(c) to rely on guidance published by the sec staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. however, the sec's guidance was issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and much of the guidance was issued more than 20 years ago. no assurance can be given that the sec staff will concur with our classification of our assets. in addition, the sec staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from regulation under the 1940 act. if we are required to re-classify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exclusion from the definition of an "investment company" provided by section 3(c)(5)(c) of the 1940 act. to the extent that the sec staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to any assets we have determined to be qualifying real estate assets, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. in addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in a subsidiary holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold.         the sec has not published guidance with respect to the treatment of cmbs for purposes of the section 3(c)(5)(c) exemption. unless we receive further guidance from the sec or its staff with respect to cmbs, we intend to treat cmbs as a real estate-related asset.         certain of our subsidiaries may rely on the exemption provided by section 3(c)(6) to the extent that they hold mortgage assets through majority-owned subsidiaries that rely on section 3(c)(5)(c). the sec staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly.         we determine whether an entity is one of our majority-owned subsidiaries. the 1940 act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. the 1940 act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. we treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the 40% test. we have not requested the sec to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and the sec has not done so. if the sec were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40% test. any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us. 58 table of contents         on august 31, 2011, the sec issued a concept release titled "companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments" (sec release no. ic-29778). under the concept release, the sec is reviewing interpretive issues relating to section 3(c)(5)(c) of the 1940 act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage reits should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. there can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 act status of reits, including the sec or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. if we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 act, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company, any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for our shares of common stock. rapid and steep declines in the values of our cre finance-related investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a reit or exemption from the 1940 act.         if the market value or income potential of real estate-related investments declines as a result of increased interest rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our reit qualification or exemption from the 1940 act. if the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. this difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. we may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the reit and 1940 act considerations. our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover on claims against our directors and officers are limited, which could reduce our stockholders and our recovery against them if they negligently cause us to incur losses.         the mgcl provides that a director has no liability in such capacity if he performs his duties in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. a director who performs his or her duties in accordance with the foregoing standards should not be liable to us or any other person for failure to discharge his or her obligations as a director.         in addition, our charter provides that our directors and officers will not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages unless the director or officer actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, or is adjudged to be liable to us or our stockholders based on a finding that his or her action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding. our bylaws require us, to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to any individual who is a present or former director or officer and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member or manager of another corporation, reit, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. with the approval of our board of directors, we may provide such indemnification and advance for expenses to any individual who served a predecessor of the company in any of the 59 table of contents capacities described above and any employee or agent of the company or a predecessor of the company, including our manager and its affiliates.         we also are permitted to purchase and maintain insurance or provide similar protection on behalf of any directors, officers, employees and agents, including our manager and its affiliates, against any liability asserted which was incurred in any such capacity with us or arising out of such status. this may result in us having to expend significant funds, which will reduce the available cash for distribution to our stockholders. our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management.         our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. these requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of the company that is in the best interests of our stockholders. pursuant to our charter, our board of directors also is divided into three classes of directors. the initial terms of the first, second and third classes will expire in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. beginning in 2013, directors of each class will be chosen for three-year terms upon the expiration of their current terms, and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders. the staggered terms of our directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.         in order for us to qualify as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december 31, 2012, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year after 2012. "individuals" for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. to preserve our reit qualification, our charter generally prohibits any person (except ares investments which is subject to a 22% excepted holder limit) from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. this ownership limitation could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. u.s. federal income tax risks our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a reit would subject us to u.s. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.         we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december 31, 2012. however, we may terminate our reit qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a reit is in the best interests of our stockholders, or inadvertently. our qualification as a reit depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. we have structured and intend to continue structuring our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a reit. the reit qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the u.s. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit is limited. 60 table of contents accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a reit. our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. our compliance with the reit income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by internal revenue service, or the "irs," such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a reit. furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a reit.         if we fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. in addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year of losing our reit qualification. losing our reit qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. in addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. if this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax. reits, in certain circumstances, may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.         even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit, we may be subject to u.s. federal income taxes and related state and local taxes. for example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a reit (a "prohibited transaction" under the code) will be subject to a 100% tax. we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits. similarly, if we were to fail an income test (and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect) we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements. we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay u.s. federal income tax directly on such income. in that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. however, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file u.s. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. we also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed reit taxable income. we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll, mortgage recording and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our trss, which are subject to full u.s. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you. to qualify as a reit we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. this could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.         in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with gaap), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our undistributed reit taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior 61 table of contents years. these requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions. although we intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid u.s. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a reit, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so. certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.         for so long as we qualify as a reit, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our reit qualification. under applicable provisions of the code regarding prohibited transactions by reits, while we qualify as a reit, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding trss, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. while we qualify as a reit, we avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a trs (but such trs will incur income taxes), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with a prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the code for properties held for at least two years. however, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding trss, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans that would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes.         a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. we might be subject to this tax if we were to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans as inventory for u.s. federal income tax purposes. therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans, other than through a trs, and we may be required to limit the structures we use for our securitization transactions, even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us. trss are subject to corporate-level taxes and dealings with trss may be subject to 100% excise tax.         a reit may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more trs. both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs. a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs. overall, no more than 25% of the gross value of a reit's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs. in addition, the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. the rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm's length basis. 62 table of contents         trss that we may form will pay u.s. federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us, unless necessary to maintain our reit qualification. while we will be monitoring the aggregate value of the securities of our trss and intend to conduct our affairs so that such securities will represent less than 25% of the value of our total assets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the trs limitation in all market conditions. our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize "phantom income" for u.s. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments, and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good reit asset, thereby jeopardizing our reit qualification.         our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on gaap, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. for example, we may acquire assets, including debt securities requiring us to accrue oid or recognize market discount income, that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets referred to as "phantom income." in addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.         as a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the reit distribution requirements in certain circumstances. in such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable distribution of our shares of common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements.         moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that require subsequent modification by agreement with the borrower. if the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt taxable exchange with the borrower. this deemed reissuance may prevent the modified debt from qualifying as a good reit asset if the underlying security has declined in value and would cause us to recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt. the failure of mortgage loans subject to a repurchase agreement or a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit.         we have entered into repurchase agreements under which we will nominally sell certain of our assets to counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. we believe that we will be treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreements notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. it is possible, however, that the irs could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a reit.         in addition, in order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the reit asset and income tests, generally the loan must be secured by real property. we may originate or acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property 63 table of contents but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property. in revenue procedure 2003-65, the irs provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the revenue procedure, be treated by the irs as a qualifying real estate asset. although the revenue procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor. we cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for reit qualification purposes. if any such loan fails either the reit income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a reit. our qualification as a reit and exemption from u.s. federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets that we acquire, and the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our reit qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.         when purchasing securities, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities, or statements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and also to what extent those securities constitute real estate assets for purposes of the asset tests and produce qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. in addition, when purchasing the equity tranche of a securitization, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel regarding the qualification of the securitization for exemption from u.s. corporate income tax and the qualification of interests in such securitization as debt for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our reit qualification and result in significant corporate level tax. the taxable mortgage pool, or "tmp," rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.         securitizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of tmps for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a result, we could have "excess inclusion income." certain categories of stockholders, such as non-u.s. stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and certain tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to any such excess inclusion income. in the case of a stockholder that is a reit, regulated investment company, or ric, common trust fund or other pass-through entity, our allocable share of our excess inclusion income could be considered excess inclusion income of such entity. in addition, to the extent that our common stock is owned by tax-exempt "disqualified organizations," such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of any excess inclusion income. because this tax generally would be imposed on us, all of our stockholders, including stockholders that are not disqualified organizations, generally will bear a portion of the tax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a tmp. a ric, or other pass-through entity owning our common stock in record name will be subject to tax at the highest u.s. federal corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their owners that are disqualified organizations. moreover, we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. finally, if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, any tmp securitizations would be treated as separate taxable corporations for u.s. federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated u.s. federal corporate income tax return. these limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions. 64 table of contents we may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.         in connection with our qualification as a reit, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with gaap), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. in order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder. taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a result, u.s. stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received. accordingly, u.s. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to certain non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.         various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the irs. no assurance can be given that the irs will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met. dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.         the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20% beginning in 2013. dividends payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate. although this does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including our common stock. if we were considered to actually or constructively pay a "preferential dividend" to certain of our stockholders, our status as a reit could be adversely affected.         in order to qualify as a reit, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with gaap), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. in order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for reits, and to provide us with a reit-level tax deduction, the distributions must not be "preferential dividends." a dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock 65 table of contents as set forth in our organizational documents. currently, there is uncertainty as to the irs's position regarding whether certain arrangements that reits have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a distribution reinvestment program inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased). there is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends; therefore, if the irs were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed to have failed the 90% distribution test, and our status as a reit could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure. while we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, we can provide no assurance to this effect. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.         the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable treasury regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our taxable reit subsidiaries would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, losses in a taxable reit subsidiary generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such taxable reit subsidiary. complying with reit requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.         to qualify as a reit, we must ensure that we meet the reit gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified reit real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities. the remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. in addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs. if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit. these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock.         in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares 66 table of contents of our common stock. additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. you also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.         although reits generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a corporation. as a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders. our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders. potential
