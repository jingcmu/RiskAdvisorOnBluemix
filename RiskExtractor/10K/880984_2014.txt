item 1a. risk factors   we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward-looking information.  however, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections.  the following risks and uncertainties, together with other factors not presently determinable, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections. general factors   we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments.   in 2013, each of our companies experienced delays in anticipated orders, lower than planned sales volume and in the case of ussi, technical challenges that collectively and materially have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our financial performance in the future. we have a history of operating losses, and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years.  in 2011, 2012 and 2013, we had operating losses of $8.0 million, $20.7 million and $31.0 million, respectively.  cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was $7.8 million, $22.2 million and $17.8 million, respectively.   we do not presently anticipate pursuing new acquisitions and investment opportunities unless they support our existing businesses, but we do expect to continue to support the financing needs of ussi and possibly our other subsidiaries. while we plan for gridsense and omnimetrix (as a combined operating unit) as well as dsit to be net cash flow neutral going forward, each of these companies may from time to time need temporary support for their financing needs.  while we have taken steps to reduce our corporate cash expenses and currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months depending on our corporate strategy, we may need additional funds to finance future activity we wish to undertake.  we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable.  we may have to limit or adjust our operating strategy in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals.  we do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. investors may never obtain a return on their investment. in october 2011, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which acorn expected to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock. we suspended this policy after our march 2013 dividend payment and do not presently intend to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future. we intend to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and expansion of our business. accordingly, you will need to rely on sales of your common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on your investment. we depend on key management for the success of our business.   our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team, including john moore, jim andersen, joseph musanti, benny sela and michael barth.   the loss of the services of any of these key managers could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.  we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of these employees other than for our ceo, john a. moore.  we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management if their services were no longer available. we believe the ultimate success of ussi will depend on our ability to market successfully to the oil and gas sector, and thus we intend to recruit personnel with ties to and experience in that industry. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit such personnel or that the terms on which we may be able to do so will be favorable to us.   loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations.   we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel.  the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers.  the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules.  the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers.  although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non-competition agreements, the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured.  our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel.  if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, our business could be disrupted.  16 table of contents our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect.   a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock or the common stock of our subsidiaries. if the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. in addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.  compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations.   keeping informed of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting standards, including the sarbanes-oxley act, dodd-frank act, as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources.  compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities. new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses. the sec released final rules in august 2012 regarding mandatory disclosure by public companies of sourcing information related to their use of “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. we were required to conduct specified due diligence activities for the 2013 calendar year, and will have to provide our first report in may 2014. a challenge to the rules filed by the national association of manufacturers and the u.s. chamber of commerce in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia was unsuccessful and the rules remain in force. we thus have determined that conflict minerals are necessary for the functionality of many of our products, and have taken, and will continue to undertake, prescribed steps to determine their origin. we anticipate that fulfilling our compliance obligations with the rules will continue to be both time consuming and potentially costly. although the exact amount cannot be determined at this time, commentators have suggested compliance could costs companies like ours as much as several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. although our costs have been (and we expect will continue to be) substantially lower, we may also incur additional expenses related to any changes to our products we may decide are advisable based upon our due diligence findings, as well as increased supply costs as alternative supply sources may not be competitively priced.  we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.   part of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies or complimentary companies for our subsidiaries. although we do not presently foresee making such acquisitions in the near term unless they support our existing businesses, if we did so, any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition's management into our controls, systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   our strategy is to continue to integrate any newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies.  integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences.  integrating acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:   • failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; • inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies; • dilution of existing stockholders; • potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management; • difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies; • difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies, sales and marketing, and research and development efforts; and • difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures. in order to grow, one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions, although we do not currently plan any significant acquisitions. any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require  17 table of contents substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing.  we anticipate the need to closely manage our cash for the foreseeable future and cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources. we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.   as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements. the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, dodd-frank act and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") and nasdaq, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies.  these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities.  we expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations, we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs.  we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel, but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. the conflict minerals reporting requirement discussed above is a direct consequence of our public status.   we may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.   from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. several law firms issued press releases for the apparent purpose of seeking clients to bring claims against us in connection with the impairment and restructuring charges we announced at omnimetrix last fall, but to date no lawsuits have been filed against us. we believe we have abided by all applicable laws and would vigorously defend any such suits were they to be commenced. any legal proceedings can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to impairment evaluations and as a result, we could be required to write off some or all of these intangibles, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in accordance with applicable accounting principles, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed if certain conditions exist. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded impairments of $1.9 million and $4.8 million of goodwill and intangibles, respectively, associated with our omnimetrix subsidiary. any additional impairment of the value of recorded goodwill or other intangibles at any of our other subsidiaries will result in an additional charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods. while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past, we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form 10-k. our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   as a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail  18 table of contents to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful, others may duplicate our technology.   our operating companies rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.  our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, systems designs and manufacturing processes.  the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage.  we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or, in the case of patents issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes.  further, a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas.  even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours. we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property.  while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so.  these actions could place our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products, systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends. furthermore, it is not practical from a cost/benefit perspective to file for patent or trademark protection in every jurisdiction where we now or in the future may conduct business. in those territories where we do not have the benefit of patent or trademark protections, our competitors may be able to prevent us from selling our products or otherwise limit our ability to advertise under our established product names and we may face risks associated with infringement litigation as discussed below.   we rely, to a significant degree, on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.  these trade secrets either cannot be protected by patent protection or we have determined that seeking a patent is not in our interest.  these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.  our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors.   third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful.  we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights. in recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology-related industries and we believe that the industries in which certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity.    third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop, manufacture or provide our current and future products, systems or services infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights.  we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products, systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others or incur additional marketing costs if we are prevented from using existing product names.  the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology, products, systems and services.  in addition, the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty.   litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.  the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks.  claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers.  however, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all.  any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services.  we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services. we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights.  19 table of contents it can be difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.         as part of our business operations, we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. insurance products are impacted by market fluctuations and can become expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain. there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance at an affordable price for the required limits. our failure to obtain such insurance could lead to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or cause us to be out of compliance with our contractual obligations. two of our subsidiaries, ussi and gridsense, do business in california, which is known to experience earthquake activity. insurance coverage for earthquake-related damage is expensive and neither company presently maintains earthquake policies. we may in the future be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company. while insurance can mitigate some of this risk, due to our current size and limited operating history, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance with significant coverage limits. our customers may not accept the terms we have been able to procure and seek to terminate our existing contracts or cease to do business with us. the timing and amount of revenue generated both from new customer orders and backlog fulfillment are subject to substantial volatility recognition of revenue from sales to certain customers can be subject to delays beyond our control, such as timing of the receipt of component parts (particularly at ussi with respect to cables), change orders issued by the customer and delays in customers’ scheduled installation dates (primarily at gridsense and dsit), all of which we generally accommodate at no cost to the customer as part of our marketing efforts to them for repeat business.  concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments, which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, restricted deposits and accounts receivable.  the company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits were deposited with u.s., israeli and australian banks and other financial institutions and amounted to $17.6 million at december 31, 2013.  the company uses major banks and brokerage firms to invest its excess cash, primarily in money market funds. the counterparty to the company's restricted deposits are two major israeli banks. the company does not believe there is significant risk of non-performance by these counterparties. related credit risk would result from a default by the financial institutions or issuers of investments to the extent of the recorded carrying value of these assets.  approximately 33% of the accounts receivable at december 31, 2013, were due from two customers which pay their receivables over usual credit periods.  credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the company’s customer base. approximately 77% of the balance in unbilled revenue at december 31, 2013 was due from four customers that when billed, pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods.  credit risk with respect to the remaining balance of unbilled revenue is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base.   results from our past successful sales of subsidiary companies may not be repeated in the past, we have sold certain former subsidiaries (comverge and coalogix) at a profit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repeat these successes with one or more of our current subsidiaries.  we invest in companies before they have a meaningful history of revenues and whether we can operate these entities successfully or realize any profit on our investments in them cannot be determined.    we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. our u.s. federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2012 are currently under examination by the irs.  we believe this audit primarily relates to our net operating loss carryback which resulted in our recently received tax refund of approximately $1.7 million.  if the irs were to disallow a portion of our tax losses our net operating losses for future years may be reduced. in addition, the examination could result in other positions we have taken being challenged by the irs.  we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our deferred tax asset valuation account. as of december 31, 2013, based on the technical merits of our tax return filing positions, we believe that the benefit of such positions should be sustained upon the resolution of our audit resulting in no significant impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows.  20 table of contents   risks related to ussi   ussi has a limited operating history.   ussi was formed in november 2007 and has a limited operating history.  most of its products are at the development stage and substantial time, effort and financial resources will be required to complete development of its products, fund the cost of customer evaluations and ramp up its production and sales infrastructure.  ussi’s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, especially one that is dependent on developing new products for the oil and gas industries.  the likelihood of ussi’s success should be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business such as uncertainty in product development, uncertainty in market acceptance of its products, competition, and changes in business strategy.  ussi has no assurance that it will be successful in its business activities. ussi has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability; it must monitor and potentially adjust expenses to keep them aligned with anticipated activities. since its inception, ussi has had annual operating losses. ussi expects to continue to have operating losses for the year ending december 31, 2014 and possibly beyond (depending on revenue levels) as a result of increased operating expenses required to resolve key technical issues primarily related to peripheral technology needed to field a full system such as high temperature/high pressure seals, downhole fiber optic connectors and downhole clamps. the time and effort required to qualify these peripheral components delayed our ability to ship trial products to customers and ultimately to field a commercial product, both of which limited our ability to generate revenue in 2013. ussi can provide no assurance that it will ultimately generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable, to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows. we previously ramped up manufacturing capabilities and staff in anticipation of order volumes we expected would occur during the second half of 2013. due to the issues described above, those expectations were not realized prior to the end of 2013. we are proactively monitoring operating expenses to ensure that they are in line with our current and expected near term activities and will make adjustments if necessary. we may also make strategic hires of additional personnel with experience in the oil and gas industry to assist with our penetration into this complex market.   ussi will need additional financing to grow its business and finance its operations.   in the period since acorn's initial investment in november 2009 through december 2012, we invested $14.75 million directly in ussi. in 2013 we invested another $6.0 million in ussi under two stock purchase agreements and advanced an additional $1.4 million in contemplation of another stock purchase agreement. we anticipate investing an additional $4.7 million in ussi during 2014 (of which $1.3 million has already been transferred), which may increase over the course of the year depending on developments at the company. while ussi has an agreement with a bank for a $1.5 million line-of-credit (which amount may increase to $2.0 million if ussi meets certain conditions - see liquidity), we have no assurance whether and to what extent ussi will have access to its entire bank facility as its availability is subject to certain financial and other covenants. we have no assurance that ussi’s future capital needs will not exceed the amount of the credit line or the amounts acorn is able to provide to ussi, or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow in the future to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources.  furthermore, we may need to raise additional funds to fund ussi if revenues fail to meet or if costs exceed projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies.  if additional funds are raised through issuance of acorn equity or debt convertible into acorn equity this will dilute acorn stockholders. if the funds are raised through the direct issuance of ussi equity or convertible debt securities to third parties, acorn’s percentage ownership of ussi would be reduced. in addition, should additional funds be needed, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms.  if funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, ussi may not be able to fund its operations, make the investments needed to grow its business or respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities.  accordingly, this could materially and adversely affect ussi’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   ussi is a small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.    21 table of contents some of ussi’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than does ussi. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with ussi’s existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than can ussi to its products, which would allow them to respond more quickly than ussi to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.   ussi’s products require additional development and design; recent evaluation trials have shown us that the products will require additional customer evaluation and approval before we can expect commercial orders.   ussi’s products are undergoing technical refinement in order to meet customer needs.  in addition, ussi’s products may require additional engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs.  in connection with recent customer trials, ussi has experienced various design challenges that have negatively impacted product performance. although feedback from several customers indicates that the data read from our sensors meets or exceeds our quality claims, several customers have requested improvements regarding the blocking of water from entering the fiber optic cable (primarily a solution to prevent a crack in the fiber optic cable from allowing water to penetrate the entire array), noise cancellation (a process to eliminate the impact of ambient noise on frac detection) and improved clamping mechanisms to improve vector fidelity (the ability to identify the location of a fracture point with precision). we believe that we have provided or are close to achieving solutions responsive to each of these concerns, however, the need to resolve these technical issues has delayed product shipment beyond the time frame we had previously anticipated. in the interim, customers continue to rely on existing competing technology, primarily conventional retrievable downhole sensors. where these systems are not capable of sustained performance (i.e., in high temperature, long-term deployments), well owners are simply foregoing monitoring. there can be no assurance that ussi will be successful in developing and refining its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. the announced full-scale test will be the first time our product has been deployed in deep depth high temperature well for microseismic monitoring and we may not have the same survivability or performance as experienced in our lab testing. while we have conducted successful laboratory experiments exposing our sensors to high temperatures over extended periods of time with no loss of performance, we cannot predict whether real well conditions will produce a different result and any loss of sustainability or performance could negatively impact the customer’s and other interested parties’ acceptance of our products. ussi has not yet proved its ability to manufacture its products in commercial quantities.  in order to be successful, ussi's products must be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost and must meet customer quality specifications.  we believe that ussi's space and manufacturing capabilities at its current facilities in chatsworth, california are sufficient to handle a large increase in sales for the future.  ussi implemented an internal iso 9001quality management system that has been certified by an independent, internationally recognized audit agency. without such certification, ussi would not be able to become an approved production supplier to the major oil companies and oilfield service companies. ussi has increased its production staff and has developed proprietary automated manufacturing/assembly stations for its products which to date have been only partially implemented. ussi has also implemented inventory control and tracking systems necessary to support larger scale production, but such systems have either not yet been fully tested or are not yet fully operational.  in addition to adding internal staffing and resources, ussi may consider potential opportunities to acquire third party manufacturing capacity through acquisition or contract manufacturing arrangements, and whether or when we will find such arrangements on terms acceptable to ussi cannot be determined. whether such systems and the personnel with the skills to effectively operate them can be put in place to meet customer orders on a timely and high quality basis can also not be determined.  failure to do so could result in delays or failures in meeting customer demand, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and orders.  such difficulties could materially and adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of ussi. even if ussi is able to field a commercial a product, there can be no assurance that customers will purchase it. one of our goals for ussi, assuming that we can prove that our tool works, is demonstrating its value to, and obtaining orders from, customers.  leading industry participants previously indicated to us that they would monitor all their frac jobs if equipment cost can be reduced by 75% below the cost of monitoring with the traditional technology  (which we believe is achievable by utilizing ussi fiber optic sensor systems). based on our current understanding of the marketplace and customer constraints, we cannot predict the pace or rate of adoption.  we remain optimistic, however, that the market for advanced seismic monitoring will nevertheless be sizable based upon current pricing of $250,000 (for a 10-level system) to $1.0 million for a larger (40-level) monitoring system. ussi is investigating the possibility of implementing a rental fleet or adopting other strategies to accelerate the pace of adoption but no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful.  22 table of contents ussi is dependent on suppliers who provide it with key components for some of its products.   ussi's products incorporate “state of the art” technologies. as such, in many cases there are a limited number of suppliers of key components. in particular, ussi currently relies on a single source for the supply of one of the basic circuit boards used in its high-end interrogators for some of its technologically advanced product offerings. ussi has licensed alternative interrogator technology that is much more advanced from northrop grumman that was initially developed for large-scale u.s. navy fiber optic sonar applications and intends to field its own high performance interrogator during the first half of 2014. any development delays could materially and adversely affect ussi's business, results of operations and financial condition. where possible, ussi attempts to develop secondary back-up suppliers for key components. ussi also relies upon a single supplier for the fiber optic cables used in its systems. due to the increasing demand for fiber optic cables in the oil & gas industry, ussi is experiencing longer lead times in obtaining these cables for its products, which could delay future shipments. therefore, ussi intends to develop and qualify a second source for these cables, however, there can be no assurance as to whether or when such efforts will be successful. ussi’s targeted customers may be reluctant to try its alternative solution despite its increased reliability and lower cost; we also face competition from suppliers of other solutions who may have superior resources.   potential customers may elect to continue to use the existing expensive and less reliable technologies given their familiarity of the existing products in the market.  budget constraints at our customers may also limit the level of adoption even by customers who recognize the value of our solutions. the competition in ussi’s markets may have superior resources and marketing ability which could lead to potential customers selecting existing products or other new products over ussi’s solutions. while ussi continues to develop its products and invest in marketing efforts accordingly, there is no assurance that ussi’s products will be preferred in the market place relative to competitors with superior overall resources.  if the market place does not adopt ussi’s products as anticipated, ussi’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. failure to accurately forecast costs of future fixed-priced contracts could reduce ussi’s margins.   ussi's current proof-of-concept projects which generally produce negative gross margins due to non-recurring engineering design costs ("nre") associated with the proof-of-concept are expected to lead to follow-on projects on a fixed price basis. ussi has been following this strategy to ensure it retains ownership of all of the key intellectual property needed to field such systems. when working on a fixed-price basis, ussi expects to undertake to deliver solutions to a customer’s specifications or requirements for a particular project.  the profits from these projects are expected to primarily be determined by ussi’s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs.  costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors, including underestimating costs, difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract.  if, for any reason, ussi’s costs are substantially higher than expected, ussi may incur losses on such fixed-price contracts. ussi may lose sales if it is unable to obtain government authorization to export its products. the export of some of ussi’s products may be subject to export controls imposed by the u.s. government and administered by the u.s. departments of state and commerce. in certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department.  for products subject to the export administration regulations (“ear”) administered by the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination and the identity of the end user.  all ussi products that are exported are subject to ear; however, most of ussi’s equipment is considered ear99.  ear99 items generally consist of low-technology consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations. however, if ussi were to attempt to export an ear99 item to an embargoed country, to an end-user of concern (as defined by the u.s. department of commerce) or in support of a prohibited end-use (as defined by the u.s. department of commerce), ussi would be required to obtain a license. exports of certain ussi products may also be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations (“itar”) regulations administered by the department of state’s directorate of defense trade controls and may require a license.   certain possible exports of products and technical data by ussi to dsit in connection with the pauss project and related projects will require either an ear or itar license and it cannot be determined at this time if licenses will issue at all, on a timely basis or on acceptable terms.  23 table of contents obtaining export licenses generally can be difficult and time-consuming. failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect ussi’s business, financial condition and results of operations. compliance with u.s. government regulations may also subject ussi to additional fees and costs. the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect ussi’s competitive position. limited protection of proprietary technology; risks of infringement.   ussi’s success is heavily dependent upon its internally developed technology.  ussi has filed patents covering the specific use and novel inventions developed internally.  to further protect its proprietary rights, ussi relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions.  as part of its confidentiality procedures, ussi enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees, as well as select consultants and strategic partners and ussi limits access to, and distribution of, its designs and proprietary information.  despite these efforts, ussi may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights.  in addition, the expense associated with the enforcement of ussi’s proprietary rights may be substantial. risks related to dsit solutions   failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed-priced contracts could reduce dsit's margins.   when working on a fixed-price basis, dsit undertakes to deliver software or integrated hardware/software solutions to a customer’s specifications or requirements for a particular project.  the profits from these projects are primarily determined by dsit's success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs.  costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors, including underestimating costs, difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract.  if, for any reason, dsit's costs are substantially higher than expected, it may incur losses on fixed-price contracts. we recognize revenues on construction contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record revenue as work on the contract progresses. the cumulative amount of revenues recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that man-months incurred to date bear to estimated man-months. accordingly, contract revenues and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when such estimates are revised. estimates are based on management’s reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material. we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when estimates indicate such a loss. such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability, which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations. conditions in israel may affect our operations. political, economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations. since the establishment of the state of israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors. an ongoing state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for israel. for a number of years there have been continuing hostilities between israel and the palestinians including with the islamic movement hamas in the gaza strip, which have adversely affected the peace process and at times have negatively influenced israel’s economy as well as its relationship with several other countries. israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon, from the government of iran and other potential threats from neighboring countries, some of whom have recently undergone or are undergoing significant political changes, such as egypt and syria. in recent years there has also been a change in the relations between israel and turkey. these political, economic and military conditions in israel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. furthermore, the mandatory military commitments of some dsit personnel may temporarily impact our ability to produce our products on a timely basis if such personnel are called into service in connection with hostilities or otherwise.   exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of dsit's operations.   a majority of dsit’s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u.s dollars or are in new israeli shekels (“nis”) linked to the u.s. dollar.  at the same time, most of dsit’s expenses are denominated in nis (primarily labor costs) and are not linked to any foreign currency.  the net effect of a devaluation of the u.s. dollar relative to the nis is that dsit’s costs in dollar terms increases more than its revenues. dsit enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations; however, we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully. in 2013 the nis strengthened in relation to the u.s. dollar by 7.0%.  24 table of contents dsit is substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline.   in 2013, approximately 40% of dsit’s total revenues were concentrated in two customers. one of these customers is expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit’s revenues and cash flow for 2014. dsit is expecting to complete a project for the second customer in mid-2014. while dsit does expect future follow on orders from this customer, the timing and amounts cannot be predicted. dsit's recently announced project for the supply, operation and support of an advanced underwater acoustic monitoring system effectively replaces the abovementioned projected scheduled for completion in 2014 in the company's backlog of projects. a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit.   reduction in israeli government spending or changes in priorities for defense products may adversely affect our earnings. the israeli ministry of defense is a significant customer of dsit. the israeli government may reduce its expenditures for defense items or change its defense priorities in the coming years. in addition, the israeli defense budget may be adversely affected by any reductions in u.s. foreign military assistance. there is no assurance that our programs will not be affected in the future if there is a reduction in israeli government defense spending for our programs or a change in priorities to products other than ours. political relations could limit our ability to sell or buy internationally. we could be adversely affected by the interruption or reduction of trade between israel and its trading partners. some countries, companies and organizations continue to participate in a boycott of israeli firms and others doing business with israel or with israeli companies. foreign government defense export policies towards israel could also make it more difficult for us to obtain the export authorizations necessary for our activities. also, over the past several years there have been calls in europe and elsewhere to reduce trade with israel. in addition, the israeli defense budget may be adversely affected by reductions in u.s. foreign military assistance. there can be no assurance that restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards israel or israeli businesses will not have an adverse impact on our business. dsit is a project-based business which is dependent on large orders from customers who typically have long acquisition cycles. dsit is a project-based business which is dependent on large orders from customers who typically have long acquisition cycles. dsit must constantly replace its pipeline of opportunities given what typically averages to at least an 18-month sales cycle. dsit is dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for its operations.   dsit's operations place a great reliance on it meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance its operations.  should dsit encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones, resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its operations.   dsit must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects. these guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits.   some of the projects dsit performs require significant performance and/or bank guarantees. at december 31, 2013, dsit had approximately $1.2 million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding. in addition, dsit had on deposit at two israeli banks approximately $0.3 million collateralizing some of these guarantees. these deposits are restricted and, accordingly, dsit cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released. at times, this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations.   in addition, dsit may not always be able to supply such guarantees or restricted deposits without financial assistance from acorn.  if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit, acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to it in a timely manner.   if dsit is unable to keep pace with rapid technological change, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may suffer.   some of dsit's solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence.  dsit's competitiveness and future success depends on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and  25 table of contents industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis.  a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position.  a failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay dsit's development of new products, which could result in technological obsolescence, decreased revenues, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.  to the extent that dsit fails to keep pace with technological change, its revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.   dsit is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with components for some of its products.   a number of dsit's suppliers provide it with major components for some of its products for the energy & security sonar solutions segment. some of these components are long-lead items. if for some reason, the suppliers cannot provide dsit with the component when it is needed and dsit cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms, dsit may have increased costs and/or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence. in addition, project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. while dsit is constantly attempting to develop secondary suppliers for these components, it can provide no assurance that it will be successful in doing so on acceptable terms. dsit is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.   some of dsit's current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with dsit's existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. dsit has committed resources to enter the fiber optic security arena.      dsit is currently investing significant amounts of capital in creating the infrastructure to support its entrance into the fiber optic security market. dsit planned to do this in a joint development project with ussi. because ussi has been focused on the opportunities in the oil and gas market, work on the joint dsit-ussi project (known as pauss) has slowed.  dsit has decided to pursue this market on its own, but we have no assurance that it will successfully be able to develop or ultimately integrate these products into its portfolio and be able to commercialize the applications. dsit received a bird foundation grant designated to cover 50% of the development costs of the pauss project over a period of two years. payment of the grant is dependent on continued progress being made in accordance with a contractually agreed upon time-line. dsit (together with ussi) may request an extension of this development project, though we have no assurance that such an extension would be granted. if the extension is not granted, future bird funding on the development of pauss may be at risk. in september 2013, dsit and ramot, the technology transfer company of tel-aviv university, were jointly awarded a grant from meimad. meimad provides funding money for projects involving joint innovation and development between israeli industrial companies and universities. this grant is for a 30-month project (in two stages) for the joint development of a next generation fiber-optic based perimeter security system interrogator. the total amount of the grant is approximately $650,000, and is conditioned on budget availability at the office of the chief scientist ("ocs") in the ministry of the economy in israel and achieving the project's first phase milestone (a working prototype of an interrogator and signal processing software).  if ocs funds are unavailable and/or the project's first phase milestone do not occur on a timely basis, dsit may not be able to access some or all of the grant funding.     risks related to gridsense   gridsense has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability.   gridsense incurred net losses for the years ended december 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  while gridsense has reduced its losses in 2013 compared to 2012 (despite the restructuring charge recorded in 2013) and it has a goal to be near break-even for 2014; we can provide no assurance that gridsense will generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become cash neutral or eventually achieve or sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows.  26 table of contents gridsense may need additional financing to grow and finance its operations.   during 2013, acorn continued to provide funds for gridsense's working capital needs. during 2013, acorn invested $1.5 million in gridsense for its working capital needs plus an additional $480,000 to help fund the costs of its restructuring. while we do not plan to invest additional equity into gridsense, we lent gridsense $1,125,000 in the second half of 2013 of which $850,000 was repaid to us by year-end with the balance being repaid in february 2014. at the end of 2013, gridsense signed an amendment to its loan and security agreement with a bank and expanded its line-of-credit to $1.5 million. this amendment was conditioned upon acorn agreeing to guaranty gridsense’s liabilities to the bank. we have no assurance whether and to what extent gridsense will have access to the entire $1.5 million facility as the availability is subject to a calculated borrowing base as well as certain financial and other covenants nor do we have any assurance that the bank will extend the facility past its expiration date of june 30, 2014. it is possible that gridsense will require working capital support beyond its bank facility during 2014 to finance its operations as it works to grow its revenues. additional support to gridsense may be in the form of an additional or expanded bank line, new investment by others, additional investment by acorn, or a combination of the above. we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms.  the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies, in particular ussi to whom we intend to concentrate deployment of our financial resources for the foreseeable future.   gridsense’s products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of gridsense. the primary market for gridsense’s products and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain. if the markets for gridsense’s products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition, its business will suffer. as a result, gridsense may be unable to: (i) successfully market its current products and services, (ii) develop new products, services and enhancements to current products and services, (iii) complete customer installations on a timely basis or (iv) complete products and services currently under development. if gridsense’s products and services are not accepted by its customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, gridsense’s business and operating results will be materially affected. in addition, we can provide no assurance that gridsense will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives. gridsense’s products are subject to regulatory approvals.   numerous regulations govern the manufacture and sale of gridsense’s products in the united states and other countries where gridsense intends to market its products. such regulation bears upon the approval of manufacturing techniques, testing procedures and approval for the manufacturing and sale of gridsense’s products, including advertising and labeling.   any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to market our products. furthermore, product approvals may be withdrawn if problems occur following initial marketing or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained.  the failure, delay or withdrawal of a previously given regulatory approval could materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and financial position. sales to utilities are generally characterized by long sales cycles. gridsense’s sales are largely dependent on the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support.  the purchasing cycle for a utility may involve an evaluation trial or pilot, analysis of data and results, review of competitor’s offerings and smaller scale deployments, before a purchasing decision is made.  for large orders, some utilities are required to solicit competitive bids from other vendors which can contribute significantly more time and result in lost sales opportunities. at best, the sales cycle can take several months and in certain circumstances it can be a multi-year process.  delays in securing purchase orders can materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and financial condition.    27 table of contents gridsense is attempting to broaden its revenue base by expanding into the north american market. gridsense is currently recording a significant portion of its revenue from sales generated in australia (approximately 32% for the year ended december 31, 2013 and more than 45% in both 2011 and 2012 ).  gridsense believes that growth and profitability will require additional expansion of sales in other markets, most notably the north american market.  to the extent that gridsense is unable to expand sales into other markets in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  in addition, even with the successful recruitment of additional personnel and international resellers, there can be no assurance that gridsense will be successful in maintaining or increasing international market demand for its products.   exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of gridsense’s australian operations. gridsense has operations in both the u.s. and australia. its australian operations are subject to the volatility of the australian dollar vis-à-vis the u.s. dollar. in 2013, the u.s. dollar strengthened by 13.8%, in 2012, the australian dollar strengthened by 2.2% while in 2011 the australian dollar was virtually unchanged vis-a-vis the u.s. dollar.  while risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that gridsense’s australian operation’s sales and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars, currency fluctuations may impact the translation of certain balance sheet items and ultimately affect its financial performance. during 2012, gridsense transferred substantially all of its production lines to the u.s. in order to minimize costs in australian dollars. gridsense does not employ specific strategies, such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging, to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures.   gridsense’s market is subject to rapidly changing technologies. gridsense markets its products in a field where electronics and software/firmware dominate. this fast changing area may generate unknown methods of detecting and monitoring disturbances that could render gridsense’s technology inferior, resulting in gridsense’s results of operations being materially adversely affected. gridsense does, however, closely monitor trends and changes in technologies and customer demand that could adversely impact its competitiveness and overall success.   gridsense is subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories.   some of gridsense’s competitors in the markets it serves are larger, better capitalized and have greater resources than gridsense. as gridsense grows and penetrates markets where larger companies have been established, it may experience a reduced rate of growth due to competitive forces.  competition from these competitors may have a material adverse effect on our operations, including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business. some competitors such as power delivery product, sentient and cooper have products that directly compete with gridsense at comparable price points and features. gridsense development costs and marketing costs to penetrate the market related to grid insitetm may be more than previously estimated. gridsense is still in the process of refining grid insitetm. this product allows customers to monitor their networks on a system hosted by gridsense. while development costs expended to date are in line with expectations, we have no assurance that the final grid insitetm  product will be completed within the expected time frame or budget currently anticipated. we further have no assurance that following the development of grid insitetm, that gridsense will successfully be able to integrate it into its portfolio of products and be able to commercialize the applications. furthermore, grid insitetm may require different organizational skillset and resources to penetrate the market. in contrast to gridsense's traditional way of selling hardware and equipment, grid insitetm may give the company an opportunity to sell services and generate recurring revenue streams over time.  this model may require upfront investment by the company which will be recovered through subscription revenue collected over time. as with any new product introduction there is always a risk in pace of adoption by customers.  grid insitetm represents a new and unconventional way to sell to utilities. while the gridsense believes that there is a market for hosted software solutions it is unknown how utilities will accept this new method of procuring services. limited protection of intellectual technology. gridsense invests significant resources in product development and research in order to maintain its competitiveness in the marketplace. keeping proprietary information safe from unauthorized use or disclosure is therefore an important objective. in order to protect its proprietary know-how and technology, gridsense uses a combination of patents, trade secrets, contracts, copyrights and trademarks. gridsense owns two us patents, and has one patent pending in the u.s. in addition, gridsense owns  28 table of contents one patent in canada. some of gridsense's know-how and technology may not be patentable. to protect its rights, gridsense requires employees, as well as select consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. while these agreements will provide some level of protection, they cannot provide absolute assurance that gridsense's trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information are fully safeguarded. whenever intellectual property is developed internally or acquired, gridsense will evaluate and determine the optimal mix of controls to protect itself.  risks related to omnimetrix omnimetrix has incurred net losses since our acquisition and may never achieve sustained profitability.   omnimetrix incurred a net loss of $2.6 million in 2012 since our acquisition of it in february 2012 and used $2.2 million of cash in its operations from such time through the end of 2012. in 2013, omnimetrix incurred a net loss of $11.5 million and used $4.2 million of cash in its operations.  we can provide no assurance that omnimetrix will be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to eventually sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows. omnimetrix’s ultimate viability is dependent on our ability to execute an effective restructuring plan.                 we  have implemented a restructuring plan to align omnimetrix expenses with revenue.  we continue to believe that we offer an excellent product and that a significant market exists for our monitoring services.   we developed a restructuring program that envisioned a fairly complete integration of omnimetrix with gridsense that would combine its high margin recurring revenue feature with gridsense’s historically larger but uneven sales volume to produce a machine-to-machine (m2m) asset that could ultimately increase shareholder value in the future while costing acorn very little cash going forward.  in view of the development of recent positive customer opportunities at omnimetrix, we have reconsidered our decision not to provide funding to omnimetrix and have approved a $0.5 million working capital loan to it for 2014.  we also have begun sharing resources between omnimetrix and gridsense in areas such as information technology, and have identified other areas where potential synergies exist.  in order to best position each company for growth in value, we will continue to evaluate the degree to which combining the businesses makes sense. omnimetrix current business model is predicated on the penetration rate of its pg monitoring units into the pg market. omnimetrix currently provides its pg monitoring units at minimal or no costs to customers in order to accelerate the penetration rate. in the first year of a customer relationship, payments received cover the hardware and monitoring costs and provide minimal net cash flow. in subsequent years, the cash margins on monitoring renewals provide working capital for the company's future needs. this business model has not yet been proven to be sustainable. if the pace of the demand for these pg units is below our expectations, the service monitoring revenue received from these units may not be enough to cover the fixed expenses of the company. an increase in customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing omnimetrix revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base. we reported a $1.1 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter related to the loss of business from a key customer. non-renewals or other monitoring service terminations could increase in the future due to customer dissatisfaction with our products and services, increased competition from other providers or alternative technologies. if we have an increase in our non-renewal rate, we will have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. as a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. we incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers, our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be affected. omnimetrix is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.   some of omnimetrix's current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with omnimetrix's existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer  29 table of contents requirements. in particular at the present time we are facing significant competition from generator manufacturers who offer their own monitoring solutions. omnimetrix may not be able to access sufficient capital to support growth. since our acquisition of omnimetrix in february 2012, we invested approximately $14.0 million and lent $1.0 million (through february 2014) to omnimetrix to support its growth and working capital needs. omnimetrix has been dependent on acorn's ability and willingness to provide funding to support its business and growth strategy. as noted above, acorn has approved a working capital loan to omnimetrix of $0.5 million for 2014. if additional working capital support is required at omnimetrix, acorn will evaluate whether to provide another loan or seek third-party financing. whether acorn will have the resources necessary to provide funding, or whether alternative funds, such as third-party loans, will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to acorn and omnimetrix cannot be determined. additional support to omnimetrix may be in the form of a bank line, new investment by others, additional investment by acorn, or a combination of the above. omnimetrix was not successful in recent negotiations with commercial banks for a credit facility and we otherwise have no assurance that additional support will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms.  the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies. omnimetrix must realign overhead with expected revenue. we are currently implementing a plan to align omnimetrix’s operating expenses with revenues, but whether and to what extent such alignment can be achieved has not yet been determined. there can be no assurance that our restructuring efforts will be successful or that we will have sufficient funds to sustain omnimetrix if they are not in view of our decision to focus our resources at ussi. omnimetrix sells equipment and services which monitor third-party products, thus its revenues are dependent on the continued sales of such third-party products.      omnimetrix's end-user customer base is comprised exclusively of parties who have chosen to purchase either generators or cathodic protection systems. omnimetrix has no ability to control the rate at which new generators or cp protection systems are acquired. when purchases of such products decline, the associated need for omnimetrix's products and services is expected to decline as well. if omnimetrix is unable to keep pace with changing market or customer-mandated product and service improvements, omnimetrix's results of operations and financial condition may suffer.   many of omnimetrix's existing products may require ongoing engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs.  there can be no assurance that omnimetrix will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. the cellular networks used by omnimetrix are also subject to periodic technical updates that may require corresponding updates to, or replacement of, omnimetrix's monitoring equipment. cellular networks have evolved over time to offer more robust technical capabilities in both voice and data transmission. at the present time, the changes from the so-called “2g” to “3g” and “4g” service have resulted in only limited service interruptions. omnimetrix anticipates, however, that as these new capabilities come online, it will be necessary to have equipment that can readily interface with the newer cellular networks to avoid negative impacts on customer service. not all of the costs associated with omnimetrix's corresponding equipment upgrades can be passed on to customers and the increased expenses are expected to have a negative impact on omnimetrix's operating results. a substantial portion of omnimetrix's revenues are expected to be generated not from product sales, but from periodic monitoring fees and thus it is continually exposed to risks associated with its customers' financial stability. omnimetrix sells on-going monitoring services to both pg and cp customers. it is therefore dependent on these customers continuing to timely pay service fees on an on-going basis. if a significant portion of these fees are not renewed from year-to-year, omnimetrix can expect to experience deterioration in its financial condition.  30 table of contents omnimetrix's ability to provide, and to collect revenues from, monitoring services is dependent on the reliability of cellular networks not controlled by omnimetrix. omnimetrix provides monitoring services through the use of cellular technology utilizing the networks of third-party providers. these providers generally do not warrant their services to either omnimetrix or the end users and any dropped transmissions could result in the loss of customer renewals and potential claims against omnimetrix. while omnimetrix uses contractual measures to limit its liability to customers, there is no assurance that such limitations will be enforced or that customers will not cancel monitoring services due to network issues. omnimetrix's business is dependent on its ability to reliably store and manage data, but there can be no guarantee that it has sufficient capabilities to mitigate potential data loss in all cases. the efficient operation of omnimetrix's business is dependent on its information technology systems. in addition, omnimetrix's ability to assist customers in analyzing data related to the performance of such customers' power and cathodic protection monitoring systems is an important component of its customer value proposition. omnimetrix utilizes off-site data servers, housed within a commercial data center utilizing accepted data and power monitoring and protection processes, but whether a data loss can be avoided cannot be assured in every case. omnimetrix's information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, sabotage (including theft and attacks by computer viruses or hackers), power outages; and computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure. any interruption of omnimetrix's information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. omnimetrix is currently dependent on a single subcontractor for the assembly of its products for large bulk orders. omnimetrix's ability to deliver its products to its customers on a timely basis is dependent on the production processes of its selected subcontractor. financial or production difficulties at such subcontractor could have a negative impact on omnimetrix's ability to deliver its products timely and cause a loss of customer confidence.  although more than one subcontractor is qualified to produce omnimetrix components, omnimetrix may not be able to successfully make a change in a timely manner or

related to our securities   our stock price is highly volatile.   the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. during 2013, our common stock closed at prices as low as $3.02 and as high as $9.81 per share. fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including:general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy; • quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results; • announcements of changes in our senior management; • the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers; • announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers or us; • the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets; • changes in accounting rules; • changes in investor perceptions; or • changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers. in addition, the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile. this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.   our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options.    31 table of contents almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are, or could upon exercise of options or warrants would become, eligible for sale in the public market as described below.  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect our stock price.   as of march 10, 2014, 22,189,877 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding.  as of that date we had 285,281 warrants outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.18 and 995,373 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $5.40 per share, which if exercised would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.  in addition to the options noted above, at march 10, 2014, 447,273 options are outstanding, but have not yet vested and are not yet exercisable. substantially all of our currently outstanding shares and shares issuable under our outstanding options and warrants are or would be freely tradable. we may have to offer additional securities for sale in the near future.   the $10.4 million of proceeds (net of all transaction costs) raised in october 2013 may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our plans, due to possible delays in anticipated commercialization of our ussi products, cash needs at our other subsidiaries or the occurrence of one or more other events that require us to make significant expenditures. we may need to raise additional amounts to finance the plans for our ussi business herein.  in such event, current investors will incur additional dilution in the value of their shares.   32 table of contents item 1b. unresolved
