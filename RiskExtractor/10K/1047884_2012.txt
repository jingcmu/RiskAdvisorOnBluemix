item 1a. risk factors our business routinely encounters and attempts to address risks, some of which will cause our future results to differ, sometimes materially, from those originally anticipated. below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks facing the company. the risk factors set forth below are not the only risks that we may face or that could adversely affect us. if any of the circumstances described in the risk factors discussed in this annual report on form 10-k actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. if this were to occur, the trading price of our securities could decline significantly and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10-k or in our other filings and public disclosures. in particular, the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) and item 8financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10-k.   27 table of contents risks related to our business continued adverse developments in the global capital markets, including recent defaults, credit losses and liquidity concerns, as well as recent mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies of potential repurchase agreement counterparties, could make it difficult for us to borrow money to acquire agency mbs on a leveraged basis, on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our profitability. we rely on the availability of financing to acquire agency mbs on a leveraged basis. institutions from which we obtain financing may have owned or financed mbs and other assets, which have declined in value and caused them to suffer losses as a result of the downturn in the residential mortgage market. as these conditions persist, institutions may be forced to exit the repurchase market, become insolvent or further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital or haircut required to obtain financing and, in such event, could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. during the past few years, there have been several proposed or completed mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies of investment banks and commercial banks that have historically acted as repurchase agreement counterparties. this has resulted in a fewer number of potential repurchase agreement counterparties operating in the market. fewer potential counterparties may reduce our ability to diversify and thereby attempt to minimize risk of counterparty default. in addition, many commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the residential mortgage market. these losses have reduced financial industry capital, leading to reduced liquidity for some institutions, which could also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost-effective financing for our investments. failure to procure funding on favorable terms, or at all, would adversely affect our results and may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock, series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock. the current weakness in the mortgage market could cause one or more of our lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing. this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce liquidity. furthermore, if many of our lenders are unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing, we could be forced to sell our assets at an inopportune time when prices are depressed. if one or more major market participants fails, it could negatively impact the marketability of all fixed income securities, including agency mbs, and this could negatively impact the value of the securities in our portfolio, thus reducing our net book value. if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on future repurchase arrangements with one or more of our lenders, our financial condition and earnings could be negatively impacted. the terms and conditions of each repurchase arrangement with our lenders are negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. key terms and conditions of each transaction include interest rates, maturity dates, asset pricing procedures and margin requirements. we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on our future repurchase arrangements. also, during periods of market illiquidity or due to perceived credit quality deterioration of the collateral pledged, a lender may require that less favorable asset pricing procedures be employed or the margin requirements be increased. possible market developments, including a sharp rise in interest rates, a change in prepayment rates or increasing market concern about the value or liquidity of agency mbs, may reduce the market value of our portfolio, which may cause our lenders to require additional collateral. under these conditions, we may determine it is prudent to sell assets to improve our ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support our remaining borrowings. such sales may be at disadvantageous times, which may harm our operating results and net profitability.   28 table of contents continued adverse developments in the residential mortgage market may adversely affect the value of the agency mbs in which we intend to invest. during the past several years, the residential mortgage market in the u.s. has experienced a variety of difficulties and changing economic conditions including recent defaults, credit losses and liquidity concerns. news of actual and potential security liquidations has increased the volatility of many financial assets including agency mbs. as a result, values for mbs assets, including some agency mbs, have been negatively impacted. further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and mbs markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the agency mbs in which we invest. our investments serve as collateral for our financings. any decline in their value, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, would likely make it difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place. if market conditions result in a decline in the value of our agency mbs, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. new laws may be passed affecting the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac, on the one hand, and the federal government, on the other, which could adversely affect the price of agency mbs. the interest and principal payments we expect to receive on the agency mbs in which we invest will be guaranteed by fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. unlike the ginnie mae certificates in which we invest, the principal and interest on securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are not guaranteed by the u.s. government. all the agency mbs in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the securities. since september 2008, there have been increased market concerns about fannie maes and freddie macs ability to withstand future credit losses associated with securities held in their investment portfolios, and on which they provide guarantees, without the direct support of the federal government. fannie mae and freddie mac were placed into the conservatorship of the federal housing finance agency, or fhfa, their federal regulator, pursuant to its powers under the federal housing finance regulatory reform act of 2008, a part of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008. in addition to fhfa becoming the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac, the u.s. department of the treasury has taken various actions intended to provide fannie mae and freddie mac with additional liquidity and ensure their financial stability. the u.s. treasury can hold its portfolio of agency mbs to maturity and, based on mortgage market conditions, may make adjustments to the portfolio. this flexibility may adversely affect the pricing and availability for our target assets. it is also possible that if and when the u.s. treasury commits to purchase agency mbs in the future, it could create additional demand that would increase the pricing of agency mbs that we seek to acquire. shortly after fannie mae and freddie mac were placed in federal conservatorship, the secretary of the u.s. treasury suggested that the guarantee payment structure of fannie mae and freddie mac should be re-examined. the future roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantees could be eliminated or considerably limited relative to historical measurements. the u.s. treasury could also stop providing credit support to fannie mae and freddie mac in the future. any changes to the nature of the guarantees provided by fannie mae and freddie mac could redefine what constitutes an agency mbs and could have broad adverse market implications. in addition, if fannie mae or freddie mac were eliminated, or their structures were to change radically, we would not be able to acquire agency mbs from these companies, which would eliminate the major component of our business model. our income could be negatively affected in a number of ways depending on the manner in which related events unfold. for example, the current credit support provided by the u.s. treasury to fannie mae and freddie mac, and any additional credit support it may provide in the future, could have the effect of lowering the interest   29 table of contents rate we expect to receive from agency mbs that we seek to acquire, thereby tightening the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio of targeted assets and our cost of financing that portfolio. a reduction in the supply of agency mbs could also negatively affect the pricing of agency mbs we seek to acquire by reducing the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio of targeted assets and our cost of financing that portfolio. any law affecting these government-sponsored enterprises may create market uncertainty and have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac. as a result, such laws could increase the risk of loss on investments in fannie mae and/or freddie mac agency mbs. it also is possible that such laws could adversely impact the market for such securities and spreads at which they trade. all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. certain actions taken or that may be taken in the future by the u.s. government to address the financial crisis could negatively affect the availability of financing, the quantity and quality of available products, cause changes in interest rates and the yield curve, any and each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the u.s. government, including the board of governors of the federal reserve system, the department of treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken and are considering taking actions to address the financial crisis. during 2011, the federal reserve increased its holdings of u.s. treasury securities and now owns more than $1 trillion of such securities. in september 2011, the open market committee of the federal reserve announced the launching of operation twist, in which the federal reserve would be buying approximately $400 billion of longer-term treasury securities financed by the sale of an equal amount of the federal reserves shorter-term treasury securities. these acquisitions are to occur through june 2012. in the future, the federal reserve may continue these actions or may take other similar actions. we cannot predict whether or when such other actions may occur or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while such programs are intended to spur economic activity, there are no assurances that this will occur. in fact, these actions could negatively affect the availability of financing, the quantity and quality of available products, cause changes in interest rates and the yield curve, any and each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general. a failure by the u.s. government to meet the conditions of the august 2011 debt ceiling agreement or to reduce its budget deficit or a further downgrade of u.s. sovereign debt and government-sponsored agency debt could have a material adverse impact on our borrowings and the valuations of our securities and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. as widely reported, there continues to be concerns over the ability of the u.s. government to reduce its budget deficit and resolve its debt crisis. the u.s. sovereign debt and government-sponsored agency debt were downgraded from aaa to aa+ in august 2011 and continues to be on review for a downgrade of their respective credit ratings to account for the risk that u.s. lawmakers fail to meet the conditions of the august 2011 debt ceiling agreement and/or reduce its overall debt. such failures could have a material adverse effect both on the u.s. economy and on the global economy. in particular, this could cause disruption in the capital markets and impact the stability of future u.s. treasury auctions and the trading market for u.s. government securities, resulting in increased interest rates and impaired access to credit. these factors could negatively impact our borrowing costs, our liquidity and the valuation of the securities we currently own in our portfolio, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our results of operations. mortgage loan modification programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, the agency mbs in which we invest. the u.s. government, through the federal housing authority and the federal deposit insurance corporation, has commenced implementation of programs designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures. the programs may involve, among other things, the   30 table of contents modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or extending the payment terms of the loans. in addition, members of the u.s. congress have indicated support for additional legislative relief for homeowners. these loan modification programs, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions that result in the modification of outstanding mortgage loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, the agency mbs in which we invest. we are subject to the risk that the global credit crisis, despite efforts by global governments to halt that crisis, may affect interest rates and the availability of financing in general, which could adversely affect our financing and our operating results. during the past several years, several large european banks experienced financial difficulty and were either rescued by government assistance or by other large european banks. several european governments have coordinated plans to attempt to shore up their financial sectors through loans, credit guarantees, capital infusions, promises of continued liquidity funding and interest rate cuts. additionally, other governments of the worlds largest economic countries also implemented interest rate cuts. there is no assurance that these and other plans and programs will be successful in halting the global credit crisis or in preventing other banks from failing. if unsuccessful, this could adversely affect our financing and operations as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general. as the european credit crisis continues, with the bailout of greece, and problems in other countries such as italy and spain, there is a growing risk to the financial condition and stability of major european banks. many of these banks have u.s. banking subsidiaries, which have provided financing to us, particularly repurchase agreement financing for the acquisition of various investments, including mbs investments. during 2011, the u.s. government placed many of the u.s. banking subsidiaries of these major european banks on credit watch. if the european credit crisis continues to impact these major european banks, there is the possibility that it will also impact the operations of their u.s. banking subsidiaries. this could adversely affect our financing and operations as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general. our leveraging strategy increases the risks of our operations. relative to our investment grade agency mbs, we generally borrow, on a short-term basis, between seven to twelve times the amount of our equity, although our borrowings may at times be above or below this amount. during the past several years, we have reduced our borrowings to a range of five to seven times the amount of our equity due to the uncertainty in the marketplace and the broader problems in the economy. we incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our mortgage-related assets. use of leverage can enhance our investment returns (and at times when we reduce our leverage, our profitability may be reduced as a result). leverage, however, also increases risks. in the following ways, the use of leverage increases our risk of loss and may reduce our net income by increasing the risks associated with other risk factors including a decline in the market value of our mbs or a default of a mortgage-related asset:        the use of leverage increases our risk of loss resulting from various factors including rising interest rates, increased interest rate volatility, downturns in the economy and reductions in the availability of financing or deterioration in the conditions of any of our mortgage-related assets.        substantially all of our borrowings are secured by our agency mbs, generally under repurchase agreements. a decline in the market value of the agency mbs used to secure these debt obligations could limit our ability to borrow or result in lenders requiring us to pledge additional collateral to secure our borrowings. in that situation, we could be required to sell agency mbs under adverse market conditions in order to obtain the additional collateral required by the lender. if these sales are made at prices lower than the carrying value of the agency mbs, we would experience losses.        a default of a mortgage-related asset that constitutes collateral for a repurchase agreement could also result in an involuntary liquidation of the mortgage-related asset. this would result in a loss to us of the difference between the value of the mortgage-related asset upon liquidation and the amount borrowed against the mortgage-related asset.   31 table of contents      to the extent we are compelled to liquidate qualified reit assets to repay debts, our compliance with the reit rules regarding our assets and our sources of income could be affected, which could jeopardize our status as a reit. losing our reit status would cause us to lose tax advantages applicable to reits and may decrease our overall profitability and distributions to our stockholders. we may incur increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements and that would adversely affect our profitability. substantially all of our borrowings are collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements. if the interest rates on these agreements increase, that would harm our profitability. our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements generally correspond to short-term interest rates such as libor or a short-term treasury index, plus or minus a margin. the margins on these borrowings over or under short-term interest rates may vary depending upon:        the movement of interest rates;        the availability of financing in the market; and        the value and liquidity of our mortgage-related assets. an increase in interest rates may harm our book value, which could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to you and could cause the price of our securities to decline. increases in interest rates may harm the market value of our mortgage-related assets. our hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage-related assets (during the fixed-rate component of the mortgages underlying such assets) and our fixed-rate securities are generally more harmed by these increases. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles utilized in the united states of america, or gaap, we reduce our book value by the amount of any decrease in the market value of our mortgage-related assets. losses on securities classified as available-for-sale, which are determined by management to be other-than-temporary in nature, are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current operations. an increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the volume of newly issued, or investor demand for, mbs and other mortgage-related assets, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire mbs and other mortgage-related assets that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends. rising interest rates generally reduce the demand for consumer credit, including mortgage loans, due to the higher cost of borrowing. a reduction in the volume of mortgage loans originated may affect the volume of mbs and other mortgage-related assets available to us, which could affect our ability to acquire mbs and other mortgage-related assets that satisfy our investment objectives. rising interest rates may also cause mbs and other mortgage-related assets that were issued prior to an interest rate increase to provide yields that exceed prevailing market interest rates. if rising interest rates cause us to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of mbs or mortgage-related assets or mbs or mortgage-related assets with a yield that exceeds the borrowing cost we will incur to purchase mbs or mortgage-related assets, our ability to satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends in the amount expected, or at all, may be materially and adversely affected. a flat or inverted yield curve may negatively affect our operations, book value and profitability due to its potential impact on investment yields and the supply of adjustable-rate mortgage, or arm, products. a flat yield curve occurs when there is little difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. an inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates. a flat or inverted yield curve may be an adverse environment for arm product volume, as there may be little incentive for borrowers to choose an arm product over a longer-term fixed-rate loan. if the supply of arm product decreases, yields may decline due to market forces.   32 table of contents our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements generally correspond to short-term interest rates such as libor. a flat or inverted yield curve will likely result in lower profits. additionally, a flat or inverted yield curve may negatively impact the pricing of our securities. according to gaap, if the values of our securities decrease, we reduce our book value by the amount of any decrease in the market value of our mortgage-related assets. we depend on short-term borrowings to purchase mortgage-related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage. if we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms, we will be limited in our ability to acquire mortgage-related assets and our earnings and profitability would decline. we depend on short-term borrowings to fund acquisitions of mortgage-related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage. accordingly, our ability to achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms. in addition, we must be able to renew or replace our maturing short-term borrowings on a continuous basis. moreover, we depend on a limited number of lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for our purchases of mortgage-related assets. if we cannot renew or replace maturing borrowings, we may have to sell our mortgage-related assets under adverse market conditions and may incur permanent capital losses as a result. any number of these factors in combination may cause difficulties for us, including a possible liquidation of a major portion of our portfolio at disadvantageous prices with consequent losses, which may render us insolvent. any repurchase agreements that we use to finance our assets may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt, and if these requirements are not met, our financial condition and prospects could deteriorate rapidly. our repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities pledged or sold by us to the repurchase agreement counterparty may decline in value, in which case the counterparty may require us to provide additional collateral or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. we may not have additional collateral or the funds available to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. posting additional collateral would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets. if we cannot meet these requirements, the counterparty could accelerate its indebtedness, increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from them, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy. in addition, in the event that the counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our securities may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us of the benefit of these assets. in the event that we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition and prospects could deteriorate rapidly. our use of repurchase agreements to borrow funds may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender files for bankruptcy. our borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code, giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay in the event that we file for bankruptcy. furthermore, the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that a lender files for bankruptcy. thus, the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or us.   33 table of contents because assets we acquire may experience periods of illiquidity, we may lose profits or be prevented from earning gains if we cannot sell mortgage-related assets at an opportune time. we bear the risk of being unable to dispose of our mortgage-related assets at advantageous times or in a timely manner because mortgage-related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity. the lack of liquidity may result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale. as a result, the illiquidity of mortgage-related assets may cause us to lose profits and lose the ability to earn gains. a decrease or lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business, including our ability to value and sell our assets. we invest in certain mbs or other investment securities that are not publicly traded in liquid markets. moreover, turbulent market conditions, such as those currently in effect, could significantly and negatively impact the liquidity of our assets. in some cases, it may be difficult to obtain third-party pricing on certain of our investment securities. illiquid investments typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. in addition, third-party pricing for illiquid investments may be more subjective than for more liquid investments. the illiquidity of certain investment securities may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. in addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded certain of our investment securities. as a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not have the benefit of repurchase rights or indemnification upon the breach of broad representations and warranties for all of the assets we acquire, which could increase the risk that we suffer losses on such assets. we may acquire assets from counterparties that are not able or willing to provide broad representations and warranties on such assets. even if such counterparties provide representations and warranties on the assets, they may not be contractually required to repurchase the assets or indemnify us if there are defaults with respect to the representations and warranties on the assets. to the extent that our counterparties are not contractually obligated to repurchase the assets or are unable to fulfill their indemnification obligations, we will bear the same risks with respect to such assets as if such representations and warranties were not made. if we do not have the benefit of repurchase rights or indemnification upon the breach of broad representations and warranties on our assets, we may lose money on our investments in such assets that we otherwise would not lose had such repurchase rights or indemnification been available. our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates. we engage in hedging activity from time to time. as such, we use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. when interest rates change, we expect to record a gain or loss on derivatives, which would be offset by an inverse change in the value of loans or residual interests. additionally, from time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions in connection with our holdings of mbs and government securities with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts. our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our currently anticipated hedging strategy. we cannot assure you that our use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates. it is likely that there will be periods in the future during which we will incur losses after accounting for our derivative financial instruments. the derivative financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. in addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may   34 table of contents influence the effectiveness of these strategies. poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. in addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses. the characteristics of hedging instruments presents various concerns, including illiquidity, enforceability and counterparty risks, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. hedging involves risk since hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or currently regulated by any u.s. or foreign governmental authorities. currently, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. the dodd-frank financial reform bill intends to implement rules on these matters but presently we do not know the extent of such rules or what the consequences may be on our business or on hedging instruments in general. furthermore, the enforceability of such instruments may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. the business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in its default. default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in a loss and force us to cover our commitments, if any, at the then current market price. although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses. our use of derivatives may expose us to counterparty risks. from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements to hedge risks associated with movements in interest rates. if a swap counterparty cannot perform under the terms of an interest rate swap, we would not receive payments due under that agreement, we may lose any unrealized gain associated with the interest rate swap, and the hedged liability would cease to be hedged by the interest rate swap. we may also be at risk for any collateral we have pledged to secure our obligations under the interest rate swap if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy. similarly, if a cap counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the cap agreement, in addition to not receiving payments due under that agreement that would offset our interest expense, we would also incur a loss for all remaining unamortized premium paid for that agreement. competition may prevent us from acquiring mortgage-related assets at favorable yields and that would negatively impact our profitability. our net income largely depends on our ability to acquire mortgage-related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. in acquiring mortgage-related assets, we compete with other reits, investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, other lenders and other entities that purchase mortgage-related assets, many of which have greater financial resources than us. as a result, we may not in the future be able to acquire sufficient mortgage-related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. if that occurs, our profitability will be harmed. interest rate mismatches between our adjustable-rate mbs and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of these assets may reduce our income during periods of changing interest rates. we fund most of our acquisitions of adjustable-rate mbs (including hybrid adjustable-rate mbs) with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to, but of shorter maturities than, the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mbs. accordingly, if short-term interest rates increase, this may harm our profitability.   35 table of contents most of the mbs we acquire are adjustable-rate securities. this means that their interest rates may vary over time based upon changes in a short-term interest rate index. therefore, in most cases, the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mbs that we acquire and their funding sources will not be identical, thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between our assets and liabilities. while the historical spread between relevant short-term interest rate indices has been relatively stable, there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile. during periods of changing interest rates, these mismatches could reduce our net income, dividend yield and the market price of our stock. the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable-rate mbs. for example, at december 31, 2011, our agency mbs and non-agency adjustable-rate mbs had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately 36 months, while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of 38 days. after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions, the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was 436 days. accordingly, in a period of rising interest rates, we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss because the interest rates on our borrowings adjust faster than the interest rates on our adjustable-rate mbs. the mbs in which we invest and the mortgage loans underlying the mbs in which we invest are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us. residential mortgage loans are secured by single-family residential property and are subject to risks of loss, delinquency and foreclosure. the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower. a number of factors, including a general economic downturn, acts of god, terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances, may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans. residential mbs evidence interests in or are secured by pools of residential mortgage loans and collateralized mbs evidence interests in or are secured by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans. accordingly, the mbs we invest in are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans. in the event of defaults with respect to the mortgage loans that underlie our mbs investments and the exhaustion of any underlying or additional credit support, we may not realize our anticipated return on these investments and we may incur a loss on these investments. increased levels of prepayments from mbs may decrease our net interest income. pools of mortgage loans underlie the mbs that we acquire. we generally receive payments from principal payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans. when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, this results in prepayments that are faster than expected on the mbs. faster than expected prepayments could harm our profitability as follows:        we usually purchase mbs that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time. in exchange for this higher interest rate, we pay a premium over the par value to acquire the security. in accordance with accounting rules, we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage-backed security. if the mortgage-backed security is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date, however, we expense the premium that was prepaid at the time of the prepayment. at december 31, 2011, substantially all of our mbs had been acquired at a premium.        we anticipate that a substantial portion of our adjustable-rate mbs may bear interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rates, which are equivalent to the applicable index rate plus a margin. if an adjustable-rate mortgage-backed security is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate, we will have held that mortgage-backed security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the remainder of its expected life.        if we are unable to acquire new mbs similar to the prepaid mbs, our financial condition, results of operation and cash flow would suffer.   36 table of contents prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets, general economic conditions, actions by the federal government and the relative interest rates on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. while we seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical, in selecting investments, we must balance prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each investment. no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risk. the timing and amount of prepayments could adversely affect our liquidity and our profitability. prepayments may be difficult to predict and can vary significantly over time. as a holder of mbs, on a monthly basis, we receive a payment equal to a portion of our investment principal as the underlying mortgages are prepaid. with respect to our agency mbs, we typically receive notice of monthly principal prepayments on the fifth business day of each month (more commonly referred to as factor day) and receive the related scheduled payment on a specified later date, which for (a) agency mbs guaranteed by fannie mae is the 25th day of that month (or the next business day thereafter); (b) agency mbs guaranteed by freddie mac is the 15th day of the following month (or the next business day thereafter); and (c) agency mbs guaranteed by ginnie mae is the 20th day of that month (or the next business day thereafter). this delay between factor day and receipt of payment creates a short-term receivable for us in the amount of any such principal prepayments. in general, on the date each month that the principal prepayments are announced (factor day), the value of our mbs pledged as collateral is reduced by the amount of the prepaid principal and, as a result, our repurchase agreement counterparties will typically initiate a margin call requiring the pledge of additional collateral or cash, in an amount equal to such prepaid principal, in order to re-establish the required ratio of borrowing to collateral value under such repurchase agreements. as the posting of such additional collateral or payment of cash to our counterparties is on or about factor day and is prior to the receipt of the payment to us by the agencies, this would reduce and, depending on the magnitude of such principal prepayments, could be material to, our liquidity. as a result, in order to meet such margin calls, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actions in order to maintain liquidity. if we were required to sell agency mbs under adverse market conditions, we may receive sale prices lower than we might have received if we sold those securities under normal market conditions and, if these prices were lower than the amortized cost of the agency mbs, we would incur losses. an increase in prepayment rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may experience reduced net interest income from holding fixed-rate investments during periods of rising interest rates. we generally fund our acquisition of fixed-rate mbs with short-term borrowings. during periods of rising interest rates, our costs associated with borrowings used to fund acquisition of fixed-rate assets are subject to increases while the income we earn from these assets remains substantially fixed. this reduces or could eliminate the net interest spread between the fixed-rate mbs that we purchase and our borrowings used to purchase them, which could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a loss. at december 31, 2011, 13% of our agency mbs were 15-year fixed-rate securities and 6% of our agency mbs were 30-year fixed-rate securities. interest rate caps on our adjustable-rate mbs may reduce our income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. our adjustable-rate mbs are subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during any given period. lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through maturity of a mortgage-backed security. our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions. accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while interest rate caps would limit the interest rates on our   37 table of contents adjustable-rate mbs. this problem is magnified for our adjustable-rate mbs that are not fully indexed. further, some adjustable-rate mbs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. as a result, we could receive less cash income on adjustable-rate mbs than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. these factors could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. at december 31, 2011, approximately 81% of our agency mbs were adjustable-rate securities. we may invest in leveraged mortgage derivative securities that generally experience greater volatility in market prices, thus exposing us to greater risk with respect to their rate of return. we may acquire leveraged mortgage derivative securities that may expose us to a high level of interest rate risk. the characteristics of leveraged mortgage derivative securities result in greater volatility in their market prices. thus, acquisition of leveraged mortgage derivative securities would expose us to the risk of greater price volatility in our portfolio and that could harm our net income and overall profitability. new assets we acquire may not generate yields as attractive or be as accretive to book value as have been experienced historically. we may acquire new assets as we receive principal and interest payments and prepayments from our existing assets. we also sell assets from time to time as part of our portfolio and asset/liability management programs. we may invest these proceeds into new earning assets. new assets may not generate yields as attractive as we have experienced historically. business conditions, including credit results, prepayment patterns and interest rate trends in the future, may not be as favorable as they have been during the periods we held the replaced assets. new assets may not be as accretive to book value as existing assets. the market value of our assets is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. in the past as short-term interest rates increased, the market value of our existing assets has declined. as we classify our agency mbs and non-agency mbs as available-for-sale, accounting regulations require that any unrealized losses from the decline in market value that are not considered to be an other-than-temporary impairment be carried as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheets. when short-term interest rates stop increasing, or start declining, or when the interest rates on these securities reset, the market value of these assets may increase. this may be more accretive to book value than the new assets that we acquire to replace existing assets. if we are unable to find suitable investments, we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay dividends. the availability of mortgage-related assets meeting our criteria depends upon, among other things, the level of activity and quality of and demand for securities in the mortgage securitization and secondary markets. the market for agency securities depends upon various factors including the level of activity in the residential real estate market, the level of and difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, incentives for issuers to securitize mortgage loans and demand for agency securities by institutional investors. the size and level of activity in the residential real estate lending market depends upon various factors, including the level of interest rates, regional and national economic conditions and real estate values. to the extent we are unable to acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage-related assets meeting our criteria, our results of operations would be adversely affected. furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire sufficient mortgage-related assets at spreads above our costs of funds. we are dependent on information and communications systems and such systems failures could significantly disrupt our business. our business is highly dependent on our information and communications systems. any failure or interruption of our systems, such as caused by earthquake, fire, flood or terrorist act or by issues such as power   38 table of contents outages, telephone or internet disconnections (not withstanding any of our back-up systems, which could also be subject to failure), could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities or in our repurchase agreement transactions, which would materially adversely affect our operations and performance. risks related to our management we have no employees and the manager is responsible for making all of our investment decisions. the employees of the manager are not required to devote any specific amount of time to our business. effective december 31, 2011, we have no employees and all our prior employees became employees of the manager. the manager is responsible for conducting our day-to-day operations and is responsible for the selection, purchase and sale of our investment portfolio; our financing and hedging activities; providing us with management services; and such other services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate. messrs. lloyd mcadams, joseph e. mcadams, thad m. brown, ms. bistra pashamova and others are officers and employees of our manager and are also officers and employees of pacific income advisers, or pia, where they devote a portion of their time. these officers and employees are under no contractual obligations mandating minimum amounts of time to be devoted to our company. in addition, a trust controlled by mr. lloyd mcadams is the principal stockholder of pia. these officers and employees are involved in investing both our assets and approximately $3.88 billion in mbs and other fixed income assets for institutional clients and individual investors through pia. these multiple responsibilities and ownerships may create conflicts of interest if these officers and employees of our company are presented with opportunities that may benefit both us and the clients of pia. these officers allocate investments among our portfolio and the clients of pia by determining the entity or account for which the investment is most suitable. in making this determination, these officers consider the investment strategy and guidelines of each entity or account with respect to acquisition of assets, leverage, liquidity and other factors that our officers determine appropriate. these officers, however, have no obligation to make any specific investment opportunities available to us and the above-mentioned conflicts of interest may result in decisions or allocations of securities that are not in our best interests. additionally, there is nothing in the management agreement that prevents the manager or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees from engaging in other businesses or from rendering services of any kind to any other person or entity, whether or not the investment objectives or policies of any such other person or entity are similar to those of the company or in any way binds or restricts the manager or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees from buying, selling or trading any securities or commodities for their own accounts or for the accounts of others for whom the manager or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees may be acting. mr. lloyd mcadams is also an owner and chairman of syndicated capital, inc., a registered broker-dealer. syndicated capital, inc. has been authorized by our board of directors to act as the authorized broker on any buyback of the companys common stock. the service to pia and syndicated capital, inc. by the officers and employees of the manager allow them to spend only part of their time and effort managing our company, as they are required to devote a portion of their time and effort to the management of other companies, and this may harm our overall management and operating results.   39 table of contents we are completely dependent upon the manager, who provides services to us through the management agreement, and we may not find suitable replacements for our manager if the management agreement is terminated or such key personnel are no longer available to us. the loss of any key personnel of the manager could harm our operations. we no longer have any employees and are completely dependent on the manager to conduct our operations pursuant to the management agreement. the manager has its own employees, which conduct its day-to-day operations. the management agreement does not require the manager to dedicate specific personnel to our operations. if we terminate the management agreement without cause, we may not, without the consent of the manager, employ any employee of the manager or any of its affiliates, or any person who has been employed by the manager or any of its affiliates at any time within the two year period immediately preceding the date on which the person commences employment with us for two years after such termination of the management agreement. we will not have retention agreements with any of our officers. we believe that the successful implementation of our investment and financing strategies will depend upon the experience of certain of the managers officers and employees. none of these individuals continued service is guaranteed. if the management agreement is terminated or these individuals leave the manager, the manager may be unable to replace them with persons with appropriate experience, or at all, and we may not be able to execute our business plan. we depend on the diligence, experience and skill of the officers and employees of the manager for the selection, structuring and monitoring of our mortgage-related assets and associated borrowings. the key officers of the manager include mr. lloyd mcadams, president and chief executive officer; mr. joseph e. mcadams, chief investment officer and executive vice president; mr. thad m. brown, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary; mr. charles j. siegel, senior vice president-finance and assistant secretary; ms. bistra pashamova, senior vice president; and mr. evangelos karagiannis, vice president. our dependence on the manager is heightened by the fact that they have a relatively small number of employees and the loss of any key person could harm our entire business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. in particular, the loss of the services of messrs. lloyd mcadams or joseph e. mcadams could seriously harm our business. the management agreement was not negotiated on an arms-length basis and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. at our annual stockholders meeting on may 25, 2011, our stockholders approved the entry by us into a management agreement, or the management agreement (a copy of which is included as exhibit 10.1 to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on january 3, 2012), between the company and anworth management, llc, or the manager, and the externalization of our management function. we entered into the management agreement effective as of december 31, 2011. the management agreement was negotiated between related parties, and we did not have the benefit of arms-length negotiations of the type normally conducted with an unaffiliated third party. the terms of the management agreement, including fees payable, may not reflect the terms we may have received if it was negotiated with an unrelated third party. in addition, as a result of this relationship, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the management agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our manager. if we elect to not renew the management agreement without cause, we would be required to pay the manager a substantial termination fee. these and other provisions in the management agreement make non-renewal of the management agreement difficult and costly. electing not to renew the management agreement without cause would be difficult and costly for us. with the consent of the majority of our independent directors, we may elect not to renew our management agreement   40 table of contents after the initial term of the management agreement, which would expire on december 31, 2013, or upon the expiration of any automatic renewal term, both upon 180-days prior written notice. in addition, if we elect to not renew the management agreement because of a decision by our board that the management fee is unfair, the manager has the right to renegotiate a mutually agreeable management fee. if we elect to not renew the management agreement without cause, we are required to pay the manager a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by the manager during the prior 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed month prior to the effective date of termination. these provisions may increase the effective cost to us of electing to not renew the management agreement. the management fee is payable regardless of our performance. the manager is entitled to receive a management fee from us that is based on the amount of our equity (as defined in our management agreement), regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. for example, we would pay our manager a management fee for a specific period even if we experienced a net loss during the same period. the managers entitlement to substantial nonperformance-based compensation may reduce its incentive to devote sufficient time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio. this in turn could harm our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. the fee structure of the management agreement may limit the managers ability to retain access to its key personnel. under the terms of the management agreement, we are required to pay the manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one twelfth of 1.20% of our equity. our equity is defined as our month-end stockholders equity, adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in either retained earnings or other comprehensive income, each as computed in accordance with gaap. the management agreement does not provide the manager with an incentive management fee that would pay the manager additional compensation as a result of meeting performance targets. some of our externally-managed competitors pay their managers an incentive management fee, which could enable the manager to provide additional compensation to its key personnel. thus, the lack of an incentive fee in the management agreement may limit the ability of the manager to provide key personnel with additional compensation for strong performance, which could adversely affect the managers ability to retain these key personnel. if the manager were not able to retain any of the key personnel providing services to the manager, it would have to find replacement personnel to provide those services. those replacement key personnel may not be able to produce the same operating results as the current key personnel. some investors may not view our external management in a positive light, which may affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for future offerings of our stock. although there are currently other mortgage reits that are externally-managed, there may be times in the future when some investors may have a preference for internally-managed companies. there may also be times, if there are low returns from our portfolio, when our external management is not viewed in a positive light. in either of these cases, there may be a negative effect on the market price of our common stock and this may make it difficult for future offerings of our common stock. potential conflicts of interest could arise if the manager were to take greater risk for the purpose of increasing our equity in order to earn a greater management fee. the management agreement does not contain an incentive fee. the manager is paid a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one twelfth of 1.20% of our equity, as defined in the management agreement. as the management agreement does not contain an incentive fee, the manager may take greater risk in our investment portfolio to increase our equity in order to earn a greater management fee.   41 table of contents our managers liability is limited under the management agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our manager against certain liabilities. pursuant to the management agreement, our manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow any advice or recommendation of the manager. the manager and its affiliates, and the directors, officers, employees and stockholders of the manager and its affiliates, are not liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our board of directors or our stockholders for any acts or omissions by the manager, its officers, employees or its affiliates, performed in accordance with and pursuant to our management agreement, except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their respective duties under this management agreement. we have agreed to indemnify our manager and its affiliates, its directors, officers, employees and stockholders of the manager and its affiliates (each a manager indemnified party) of and from any and all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys fees) in respect of or arising from any acts or omissions of such manager indemnified party, not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties of such manager indemnified party under this management agreement. our manager has limited resources and may not be able to defend itself in litigation. the only fee that our manager receives from us is the base management fee, as previously described. it is anticipated that most, if not all, of this fee will be used by the manager for compensation to its employees and to pay for its other administrative expenses. our manager has limited resources. if our manager were to be involved in litigation not related to our operations, it may not be able to defend itself and it may be forced to declare bankruptcy or go out of business and we would have to find another manager. this could have a material adverse impact on our business and our operations. our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval and such changes could harm our business, results of operation and stock price. our board of directors can modify or waive our current operating policies and our strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies may have on our business, operating results and stock price, however, the effects may be adverse. risks related to reit compliance and other tax matters if we are disqualified as a reit, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability. we believe that, since our initial public offering in 1998, we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and we intend to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. nevertheless, we may not remain qualified as a reit in the future. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist. even a technical or inadvertent mistake could require us to pay a penalty or jeopardize our reit status. furthermore, congress or the irs might change tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings, in each case potentially having retroactive effects that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year, then:        we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which, among other things, means being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;        any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders;   42 table of contents      we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders; and        unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification and thus our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we do not qualify as a reit. complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature and diversification of our mbs and other assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively. compliance with the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. under these provisions, any income that is generated from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate, inflation and/or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit 75% and 95% gross income tests if the instrument hedges (1) interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate or (2) risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the reit 75% or 95% gross income tests, and such instrument is properly identified under applicable treasury regulations. income from hedging transactions that does not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of both the reit 75% and 95% gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may have to limit its use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur. complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments or to make investments inconsistent with our business plan. in order to qualify as a reit, we must also determine that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified reit real estate assets. the remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. in addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer. no more than 25% of the total value of our assets can be stock in taxable reit subsidiaries. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences. the need to comply with these gross income and asset tests may cause us to acquire other assets that are qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit requirements that are not part of our overall business strategy and might not otherwise be the best investment alternative for us. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders. as a reit, we must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. at the time when we are required to make previously declared dividend distributions, declines in the value of our portfolio holdings and the resulting subsequent margins calls may have depleted most or all of our cash and cash equivalents. if this were to occur and if market conditions allowed us to do so, we would sell some of our portfolio holdings to generate sufficient funds to make the dividend payments. if market conditions did not allow us to sell portfolio holdings, we would be required to borrow funds on an unsecured basis to make the previously declared dividend payments.   43 table of contents dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates. tax legislation enacted in 2003 and extended in 2010 to be effective through december 31, 2012, temporarily reduce the maximum u.s. federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers to 15%. dividends paid by reits to these stockholders are generally not eligible for these reduced rates. although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits, the more favorable rates applicable to non-reit corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock. the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing loans, which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property but including any mortgage loans, held in inventory primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. we might be subject to this tax if we were to sell a loan or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of such inventory for federal income tax purposes. therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans other than through a taxable reit subsidiary and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us. in addition, this prohibition may limit our ability to restructure our investment portfolio of mortgage loans from time to time, even if we believe that it would be in our best interest to do so. failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act would materially harm our results of operations. we believe that we conduct our business in a manner that results in our not being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940, as amended, or the investment company act. if we fail to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as we presently do. the investment company act has an exemption for entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. under the secs current interpretation, we qualify for this exemption if we maintain at least 55% of our assets directly in qualifying real estate interests. in meeting the 55% requirement under the investment company act, we treat mbs issued with respect to an underlying pool for which we hold all issued certificates as qualifying interests. if the sec or its staff adopts a contrary interpretation, we could be required to sell a substantial amount of our mbs under potentially adverse market conditions. further, in order to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company by acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, we may be precluded from acquiring mbs whose yield is somewhat higher than the yield on mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate that could be purchased in a manner consistent with the exemption. on august 31, 2011, the sec issued a release soliciting comments on the mortgage reit exemption under the investment company act. the sec indicated in its release that it is concerned that some mortgage companies may be subject to the kinds of abuses that the investment company act was intended to address, such as misvaluations of a companys investment portfolio and excessive leveraging. the release asked for comments on or before november 7, 2011 on whether the exclusion should be narrowed or changed in such a way that these potential abuses can be curtailed. the sec also asked whether there are existing safeguards in the structure and operations of reits and other mortgage companies that would address these or similar concerns. although we believe that we have conducted our operations in a manner that would not be of the types of concerns addressed in the secs release, we could be subject to any rules or regulations that the sec could propose in changing or narrowing the current exclusion that mortgage reits rely on to maintain an exemption from the investment company act. if the sec or its staff changes or narrows this exemption, we could be required to sell a   44 table of contents substantial amount of our mbs under potentially adverse market conditions. although, at the present time, it is unknown whether the sec or its staff will make any changes to this exclusion or the nature of any such changes, it is possible that any such changes could impact our asset acquisition policy, our leverage, our liquidity, the size of our investment portfolio, our ability to use interest rate swap agreements, our ability to borrow, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we presently are not, nor do we intend to be, regulated as an investment company. fluctuations in our net income and in our book value will likely be greater than those of investment companies. this may affect investors or potential investors as to the appropriateness of our stock as compared to that of an investment company. while presently our assets are similar to those owned by some investment companies, we are not regulated as an investment company. regulation as an investment company entails all investment companies maintaining significantly lower levels of financial leverage than we have employed since our organization in 1998. because of the differences in our leverage from that of investment companies, this results in the fluctuation in net income and in book value by us to likely be greater than that experienced by investment companies. therefore, investors and potential investors in our company should, on an ongoing basis, carefully determine if this greater level of income fluctuation and book value fluctuation is appropriate for them as compared to whether the less volatile results of investment companies are more appropriate for them. we may incur excess inclusion income that would increase the tax liability of our stockholders. in general, dividend income that a tax-exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section 512 of the code. if we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to stockholders, however, then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income under section 512 of the code. if the stockholder is foreign, it would generally be subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty. u.s. stockholders would not be able to offset such income with their operating losses. we generally structure our borrowing arrangements in a manner designed to avoid generating significant amounts of excess inclusion income. however, excess inclusion income could result if we held a residual interest in a remic. excess inclusion income also may be generated if we were to issue debt obligations with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments that we received on our mortgage loans or mbs securing those debt obligations. for example, we may engage in non-remic cmo securitizations. we also enter into various repurchase agreements that have differing maturity dates and afford the lender the right to sell any pledged mortgage securities if we default on our obligations. the irs may determine that these transactions give rise to excess inclusion income that should be allocated among our stockholders. we may invest in equity securities of other reits and it is possible that we might receive excess inclusion income from those investments. some types of entities, including, without limitation, voluntarily employee benefit associations and entities that have borrowed funds to acquire their shares of our stock, may be required to treat a portion of or all of the dividends they receive from us as unrelated business taxable income. misplaced reliance on legal opinions or statements by issuers of mbs and government securities could result in a failure to comply with reit gross income or asset tests. when purchasing mbs and government securities, we may rely on opinions of counsel for the issuer or sponsor of such securities, or statements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining whether and to what extent those securities constitute real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and produce income that qualifies under the reit income tests. the inaccuracy of any such opinions or statements may harm our reit qualification and result in significant corporate level tax.   45 table of contents additional risk factors the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. the market price and marketability of shares of our securities may, from time to time, be significantly affected by numerous factors, including many over which we have no control and that may not be directly related to us. these factors including the following:        price and volume fluctuations in the stock market from time to time, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies;        significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of reits or other companies in our sector, which is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these securities;        changes in regulatory policies, tax guidelines and financial accounting and reporting standards, particularly with respect to reits;        changes in our dividend policy and earnings or variations in operating results;        any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts;        general economic trends and other external factors; and        loss of major repurchase agreement providers. fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock and, in the event that we seek to raise capital through future equity financings, our ability to raise such equity capital. we may not be able to use the money we raise from time to time to acquire investments at favorable prices. we intend to seek to raise additional capital from time to time if we determine that it is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, including through public offerings of our stock. the net proceeds of any offering could represent a significant increase in our equity. depending on the amount of leverage that we use, the full investment of the net proceeds of any offering might result in a substantial increase in our total assets. there can be no assurance that we will be able to invest all of such additional funds in mortgage-related assets at favorable prices. we may not be able to acquire enough mortgage-related assets to become fully invested after an offering, or we may have to pay more for mbs than we have historically. in either case, the return that we earn on stockholders equity may be reduced. we have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends to them in the future. we intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our common stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments, is distributed. this, along with other factors, should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the code. we have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and our ability to pay dividends may be harmed by the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10-k. all distributions to our common stockholders will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future. if we raise additional capital, our earnings per share and dividends per share may decline since we may not be able to invest all of the new capital during the quarter in which additional shares are sold and possibly the entire following calendar quarter.   46 table of contents our charter does not permit ownership of over 9.8% of our common or preferred stock and attempts to acquire our common or preferred stock in excess of the 9.8% limit are void without prior approval from our board of directors. for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification and for other reasons, our charter prohibits direct or constructive ownership by any person of more than 9.8% of the lesser of the total number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock. our charters constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of the outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding stock and thus be subject to our charters ownership limit. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of the board of directors shall be void and will result in the shares being transferred by operation of law to a charitable trust. our board of directors has granted two unrelated third party institutional investors exemptions from the 9.8% ownership limitation as set forth in our charter documents. these exemptions permitted one third party institutional investor to hold up to 15.0% of our common stock and one third party institutional investor to hold up to 20.0% of our series a preferred stock. because provisions contained in maryland law, our charter and our bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect, investors may be prevented from receiving a control premium for their shares. provisions contained in our charter and bylaws, as well as maryland corporate law, may have anti-takeover effects that delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt, which may prevent stockholders from receiving a control premium for their shares. for example, these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for our common stock or purchases of large blocks of our common stock, thereby limiting the opportunities for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then-prevailing market prices. these provisions include the following:        ownership limit.    the ownership limit in our charter limits related investors including, among other things, any voting group, from acquiring over 9.8% of our common stock or more than 9.8% of our preferred stock without our permission.        preferred stock.    our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more classes and to establish the preferences and rights of any class of preferred stock issued. these actions can be taken without soliciting stockholder approval.        maryland business combination statute.    maryland law restricts the ability of holders of more than 10% of the voting power of a corporations shares to engage in a business combination with the corporation.        maryland control share acquisition statute.    maryland law limits the voting rights of control shares of a corporation in the event of a control share acquisition. future offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock, series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock upon liquidation, or other equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock, series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock for the purposes of dividend distributions, may harm the market price of our common stock, series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock. in the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock. upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. our preferred stock may have a preference on dividend payments that could limit our   47 table of contents ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. thus, our common stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock. our charter provides that we may issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. the issuance of additional preferred stock on parity with or senior to the series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock could have the effect of diluting the amounts we may have available for distribution to holders of the series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock. the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock will be subordinated to all our existing and future debt. thus, our series a preferred stockholders and our series b preferred stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock. we may issue additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock. if we issue a significant number of shares of common stock or convertible preferred stock in a short period of time, there could be a dilution of the existing common stock and a decrease in the market price of the common stock.   item 1b. unresolved
