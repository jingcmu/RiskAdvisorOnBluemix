item 1a.risk factors we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues, and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason, a continued weakness in general economic conditions, or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income. we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system, primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen, will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future. continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists, gps and consumers is critical to our future success. if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate, if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines, our operating results would be harmed. demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions. consumer spending habits are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, gas prices, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. a general slowdown in the u.s. economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may, among other things, result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts, reduced the patient traffic in dentists’ offices, reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. continued weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment, such as intra-oral scanners. in addition, invisalign treatment, which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues, represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment, and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment. we 13 have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists, gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion, but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients. increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, reliability, aesthetics, and price compared to competing products. the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all. one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization, or the adoption and frequency of use, of the invisalign system by new and existing customers. if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate, our operating results could be harmed. we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products. in response to challenges in our business, including increased competition, we have in the past reduced the list price of our products. we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors. in addition, we sell a number of products at different list prices. if we introduce any price reductions, or consumer rebate programs; if we expand our discount programs in the future, or participation in these programs increases; if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue; or if sales by our distributors grows at a faster pace than our direct sales, our average selling price would be adversely affected and our net revenues, gross margin and net income may be reduced. furthermore, although the u.s. dollar is our reporting currency, a portion of our net revenues and income are generated in foreign currencies. net revenues and income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates. as a result, negative movements in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of net revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements. as we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to capacity constraints at our existing facilities. we are subject to growth related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel. in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively, we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to hire, train, motivate, manage and retain employees. we may be unable to manage such growth effectively. any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and prospects. in addition, in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion, we opened a new manufacturing facility in juarez, mexico at the end of 2011. we completed the transition of virtually all our scanner distribution, repair and cad/cam services from our new jersey facility to this facility in juarez, mexico in the third quarter of 2012. in addition, in october 2012, we transitioned our intra-oral scanner research and development and manufacturing operations in or yehuda, israel into a new, larger facility in the same city. expansion can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies, as well as the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other value. periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.   because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. in addition, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results. we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business. we acquired cadent holdings, inc. in april 2011. we acquired cadent for their people, their technology and their existing revenue streams such as, orthocad irecord and orthocad icast in addition to their intra-oral scanning technology. this acquisition is expected to strengthen our ability to drive adoption of the invisalign system by integrating invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors’ practices. in addition, we believe that the combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intra-oral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging align’s global sales reach, extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and large customer base. we also expect to complete the acquisition of our asia-pacific distributor in the second quarter of 2013. we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of these acquisitions. potential risks include: 14 • slower adoption or lack of acceptance for intra-oral scanning products in general or our chairside features; • our inability to increase utilization by integrating invisalign treatment more fully with intra-oral scanners; • difficulty in integrating the technology, operations, internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business; • diversion of management resources and focus from ongoing business matters; • retention of key employees following the acquisition; • aggressive competition from other manufacturers of intra-oral scanners could lengthen the customer evaluation process and result in price reductions and loss of sales; • difficulty dealing with tax, employment, logistics, and other related issues unique to international operations in israel and the asia-pacific region; • possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration; • possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies among the acquired businesses and align, which may make it more difficult to implement and harmonize worldwide financial reporting, accounting, billing, information technology and other systems; • a large portion of cadent’s operations are located in israel, accordingly, any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel may cause interruption or suspension of business operations without warning; and • negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, further impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangible assets and/or asset impairment charges. if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods, the market price for our common stock may decline. if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we will need to continue to increase our net revenues, while controlling our expenses. because our business is evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth, and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates. if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price. our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products. these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate. some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include: • limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers’ practices from quarter to quarter; • weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the united states economy and global economies; • changes in relationships with our distributors; • changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which, given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments, could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar; • changes in product mix; 15 • our inability to predict from period to period the number of trainers or the availability of doctors required to complete intra-oral scanner installations, which may impact the timing of when revenue is recognized; • if participation in our customer rebate program increases our average selling price will be adversely affected; • seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments; • success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter; • our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of sub-assemblies for our intra-oral scanners; • timing of industry tradeshows; • changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized, including as a result of the introduction of new products or promotions or as a result of changes to critical accounting estimates or new accounting pronouncements; • changes to our effective tax rate; • unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials; • any disruptions in the manufacturing process, including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes, power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control; • the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors; • major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete; • aggressive price competition from competitors; • costs and expenditures in connection with litigation; • the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors, as well as customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products; • disruptions to our business due to political, economic or other social instability, including the impact of an epidemic any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits, consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office, as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism; • inaccurate forecasting of net revenues, production and other operating costs; and • investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements. to respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, business structure or operations. most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. as a result, if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations, whether caused by changes in consumer spending, consumer preferences, weakness in the u.s. or global economies, changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product, or other factors, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues. due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. our future success may depend on our ability to develop, successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products. our future success may depend on our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software. the extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, our ability to: • correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; 16 • include functionality and features that address customer requirements; • ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers; • allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations; • differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings; • innovate and develop new technologies and applications; • the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our products; • obtain adequate intellectual property rights; and • encourage customers to adopt new technologies. if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. in addition, even if our new products are successfully introduced, it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with the invisalign system. since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient, our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available. our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration (“fda”), and foreign government agencies. any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline. a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings. we are dependent on commercial freight carriers, primarily ups, to deliver our products to our customers. if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason, we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis. if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner, our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline. in a rising fuel cost environment, our freight costs will increase. if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues, our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected. we are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business. our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the u.s. at our facility in costa rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans, which are then transmitted electronically to juarez, mexico. these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds. our order acquisition, aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez, mexico. in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose, california facility, we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose, costa rica and moscow, russia. in addition, our customer-care, accounts receivable, credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica. we also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly, intra-oral scanner manufacturing and digital modeling of our intra-oral scanners occurs. our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation, including: • difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations; • difficulties in managing international operations; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 17 • import and export license requirements and restrictions; • controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process; • political, social and economic instability, including as a result of increased levels of violence in juarez, mexico or the middle east; • acts of terrorism and acts of war; • interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services; • product or material transportation delays or disruption, including as a result of health epidemics restricting travel to and from our international locations or as a result of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions; • burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws; • trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; and • potential adverse tax consequences. if any of these risks materialize in the future, we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue. a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process. if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand, the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations. training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days. as a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect. such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers. this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations. our headquarters, digital dental modeling processes, and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose, costa rica. the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software. in addition, our customer facing operations are located in costa rica. our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez, mexico. both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters. if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located, our ability to create clincheck treatment plans, respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time. in addition, our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area. an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations. any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future. currently, our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies, both within and outside the united states. many of these manufacturers, including danaher corporation, 3m, sirona dental systems, inc. and dentsply international, have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may, in the future, attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive. the expiration of key certain patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition.  large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market. furthermore, we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies. we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors, our business could be harmed. increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions, reduced gross margins, reduced profitability and loss of 18 market share, and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, volume growth, net income (losses) and stock price. we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our information technology systems are critical to our business. system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems. all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. as our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our information technology systems. to effectively manage this growth, our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable, if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity, or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner, we could have operational disruptions, have customer disputes, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating and administrative expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies, or suffer other adverse consequences. in addition, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. furthermore, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations, net revenues and operating results. we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications, such as customer facing and manufacturing tools, and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future. system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources. delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. additionally, we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software. software applications frequently contain errors or defects, especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences, among others: loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented. there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting confidential patient information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable for related damages, and our reputation could be impaired. we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers. therefore, it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our 19 customers to be secure. despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information, we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired. in addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. our insurance may not protect us from this risk. our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be harmed. litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price. our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products, both in the u.s. and in other countries. our inability to do so could harm our competitive position. as of december 31, 2012, we had issued 280 u.s. patents, 141 pending u.s. patent applications, and 224 foreign issued patents, and 134 pending foreign patent applications. we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the u.s. and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position. however, our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents. additionally, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products. in addition, any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under u.s. patents and intellectual property laws. we also rely on protection of our copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us. however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. in particular, a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect our pricing and market share. in addition, in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation. the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price. while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec, we are required to furnish in our form 10-k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. the report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments, and would increase our costs of doing business. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. if our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 20 under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (“u.s. gaap”), we review our goodwill and asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. additionally, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill and the undiscounted cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of the asset group are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates. changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined. during the third quarter of 2012, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis for our scanner and cad/cam services reporting unit. as a result, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of september 30, 2012 for our scanner and cad/cam services reporting unit and concluded that the goodwill within this reporting unit was impaired. based on our step one analysis, we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of the goodwill for the sccs reporting unit. we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of $24.7 million and an additional $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2012, representing a change in estimate, for a total impairment charge of $36.6 million. none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes. as of december 31, 2012, the remaining amount of goodwill associated with our sccs reporting unit is $40.7 million. if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products. we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales, training and marketing personnel and management teams. the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business.  our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists. few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other research institutions. thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business. furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially harmed. we had two executive departures in fiscal 2012 and we recently announced the departure of our chief financial officer effective march 4, 2013. while we have since hired replacements for the 2012 departures and are currently conducting a search for a new cfo, there is always risk of uncertainty and instability relating to our ability to find highly qualified successors for certain executive positions and to transition the duties and responsibilities of any departing key executive in an orderly manner. in addition, our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intra-oral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings. the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth, may harm our business. if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed, our net revenues could be materially harmed.          if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited. extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. from time to time, we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties. licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected. we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases. 21 we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intra-oral scanners. we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. in particular, our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers. we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source. if these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. in addition, technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes. our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth. conversely, in order to secure supplies for production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. in the event of technology changes, delivery delays, or shortages of or increases in price for these items, our business and growth prospects may be harmed. we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships. we rely on a third party manufacturer in israel to assemble our itero scanner. as a result, if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed. any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel, and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards, controls, procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner. finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intra-oral scanning products. any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships. we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business. our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets. as of december 31, 2012, our north american sales organization consisted of approximately 200 people. internationally, we had approximately 80 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31, 2012. we do not have any long-term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force. the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business. if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time, our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed. in addition, due to our large and fragmented customer base, we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product. as a result, adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed. if our distributor relationships are not successful, our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected. we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions, and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts. relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons, including: • agreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners; • we may not be able to renew existing distributor agreements on acceptable terms; • our distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of products; • our distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our products; 22 • our existing relationships with distributors may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements with other distributors; and • we may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms. complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties. our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the u.s. and internationally. fda regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other things: • product design, development, manufacturing and testing; • product labeling; • product storage; • pre-market clearance or approval; • advertising and promotion; and • product sales and distribution. our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions: • warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; • repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; • refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; • withdrawing clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and • criminal prosecution. if any of these events were to occur, they could harm our business. we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations. the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action, and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process. any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. before we can sell a new medical device in the u.s., or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval, unless an exemption applies. obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda, we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future. furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future. our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business. if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us, we may not be able to grow our business. participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, congress recently passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010. the enacted legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions. the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer will have to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which 23 such manufacturer sells its medical devices in the u.s. this tax applies to all medical devices, including our products, which could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. furthermore, our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us. the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa), including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants. the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities. extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties. in addition to medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as: • storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records; • prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order, purchase or recommendation of our products; and • the marketing and advertising of our products. complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming, and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues. we face risks related to our international sales, including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals. outside of north america, we currently sell our products in europe, asia-pacific, latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time. for sales of our products outside the u.s., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval, and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements. we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future. we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals. if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the u.s., or if we fail to receive these approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner, if at all. our business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation. medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable. although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. a product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business, and could harm our business. historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile. the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. the factors include: • quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity; 24 • changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results; • speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations; • strategic actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or acquisitions; • announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or competitors; and • general economic market conditions. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. historically, class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price. a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. these stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price. changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows: • revenue recognition; and • leases. if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted. the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal. to achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, short-term fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in u.s. dollars. if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the u.s. financial sector. in an current unstable credit environment, we might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments. we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired, which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented. our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. to date, our board of directors has designated 200,000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan. the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock. the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors. the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation, purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan. our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. 25 various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. these factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, non-deductible goodwill impairments, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates, the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans, settlement of income tax audits, and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings. during 2012, we incurred a $36.6 million impairment of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes.  in june 2009, the costa rica ministry of foreign trade, an agency of the government of costa rica, granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002. under these incentives, all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax. the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017. the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply, absent the incentives, is 30% for 2012. as a result of these incentives, income taxes were reduced by $21.8 million in 2012. in order to receive the benefit of the incentives, we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica. if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason, our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates, which could have a negative impact on our operating results. our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authority for calendar years 2006 through 2011. item 1b.unresolved
