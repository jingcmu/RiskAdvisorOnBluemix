item 1a.    risk factors         we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect our operations. additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we depend on long-term government contracts, some of which are only funded on an annual basis. if appropriations for funding are not made in subsequent years of a multiple-year contract, we may not be able to realize all of our anticipated revenue and profits from that project.         a substantial majority of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies and departments of national, state and local governments. during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately 60%, 64% and 73%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from contracts with government entities.         most government contracts are subject to the government's budgetary approval process. legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program on a year-by-year basis, even though contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, at the beginning of a program, the related contract is only partially funded, and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent fiscal year. these appropriations, and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts, may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, competing priorities for appropriation, changes in administration or control of legislatures and the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures. if appropriations are not made in subsequent years on our government contracts, then we will not realize all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract. the budget control act of 2011 could significantly reduce u.s. government spending for the services we provide.         under the budget control act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts, was triggered when the joint select committee on deficit reduction, a committee of twelve members of congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the u.s. federal budget. the sequestration is scheduled to begin on january 2, 2013, absent legislative or other remedial action, and requires $1.2 trillion in reduced u.s. federal government spending over a ten-year period. any significant reduction in federal government spending could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities, and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, we may suffer a decline in revenue.         most government contracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated by the government either at its discretion or upon the default of the contractor. if the government terminates a contract at its discretion, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profits from that contract. in addition, the u.s. government has announced its intention to scale back outsourcing of services in favor of "insourcing" jobs to its employees, which could reduce the number of contracts awarded to us. the adoption of similar practices by other government entities could also adversely affect our revenues. if a government terminates a contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in obtaining services from another source. 14 table of contents demand for our services is cyclical and may be vulnerable to sudden economic downturns and reductions in government and private industry spending. if economic conditions remain weak and decline further, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.         demand for our services is cyclical and may be vulnerable to sudden economic downturns and reductions in government and private industry spending, which may result in clients delaying, curtailing or canceling proposed and existing projects. economic conditions in the u.s. and a number of other countries and regions, including the united kingdom, are weak and may remain difficult for the foreseeable future. if global economic and financial market conditions remain weak and/or decline further, some of our clients may face considerable budget shortfalls that may limit their overall demand for our services. in addition, our clients may find it more difficult to raise capital in the future to fund their projects due to uncertainty in the municipal and general credit markets. also, the global demand for commodities has increased raw material costs, which will cause our clients' projects to increase in overall cost and may result in the more rapid depletion of the funds that are available to our clients to spend on projects.         where economies are weakening, our clients may demand more favorable pricing or other terms while their ability to pay our invoices or to pay them in a timely manner may be adversely affected. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects. if economic conditions remain uncertain and/or weaken and/or government spending is reduced, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. our contracts with governmental agencies are subject to audit, which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or, if we are charged with wrongdoing, possible temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government programs.         our books and records are subject to audit by the various governmental agencies we serve and their representatives. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. for example, as discussed elsewhere in this report, the u.s. defense contract audit agency (dcaa) issued a dcaa form 1 questioning costs incurred during fiscal 2009 by global linguists solutions, a joint venture that includes mcneil technologies, inc., in the performance of u.s. government contracts. in addition, the u.s. attorney's office (usao) has informed us that the usao and the u.s. environmental protection agency are investigating potential criminal charges relating to one of our subsidiaries' projects in the state of hawaii. if such matters are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, if one of our subsidiaries is charged with wrongdoing as a result of an audit, that subsidiary, and possibly our company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or could be prohibited from bidding on and receiving future government contracts for a period of time. furthermore, as a government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud actions, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not, the results of which could materially adversely impact our business. our operations worldwide expose us to legal, political and economic risks in different countries as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our business and financial results.         during fiscal 2012, revenue attributable to our services provided outside of the united states to non-u.s. clients was approximately 42% of our total revenue. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:  imposition of governmental controls and changes in laws, regulations or policies;  political and economic instability;  civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, or other armed conflict;  changes in u.s. and other national government trade policies affecting the markets for our services; 15 table of contents  changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and taxes;  potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations;  changes in labor conditions;  logistical and communication challenges; and  currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and other conversion restrictions.         any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. political, economic and military conditions in the middle east, africa and other regions could negatively impact our business.         last year, civil unrest, which initially began in tunisia and egypt, spread to other areas in the middle east and beyond. due to the civil unrest in libya in february 2011, we ceased providing services as the program manager for the libyan housing and infrastructure board's program to modernize the country's infrastructure. we cannot currently determine when or if we will resume services. this business disruption resulted in an operating loss, primarily due to demobilization and shutdown costs, and certain asset write-downs. if civil unrest were to disrupt our business in other countries in the middle east or other regions in which we operate, and particularly if political activities were to result in prolonged unrest or civil war, our financial condition could be adversely affected. we operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.         the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the u.k. bribery act of 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. our continued expansion outside the u.s., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. in addition, from time to time, government investigations of corruption in construction-related industries affect us and our peers. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees and contractors or material costs to us.         some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, such as afghanistan, and, until recently, iraq and libya, where the country or location is suffering from political, social or economic problems, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may incur material costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these precautions, the safety of our personnel in these locations may continue to be at risk. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. for example, as discussed above, we incurred losses related to demobilization and shutdown costs related to the cessation of our operations in libya due to ongoing civil unrests. 16 table of contents our business and operating results could be adversely affected by losses under fixed-price contracts.         fixed-price contracts require us to either perform all work under the contract for a specified lump-sum or to perform an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment determined by the actual number of units performed. in fiscal 2012, approximately 47% of our revenue was recognized under fixed-price contracts. fixed-price contracts are more frequently used outside of the united states and, thus, the exposures resulting from fixed-price contracts may increase as we increase our business operations outside of the united states. fixed-price contracts expose us to a number of risks not inherent in cost-plus and time and material contracts, including underestimation of costs, ambiguities in specifications, unforeseen costs or difficulties, problems with new technologies, delays beyond our control, failures of subcontractors to perform and economic or other changes that may occur during the contract period. losses under fixed-price contracts could be substantial and adversely impact our results of operations. we conduct a portion of our operations through joint venture entities, over which we may have limited control.         approximately 13% of our fiscal 2012 revenue was derived from our operations through joint ventures or similar partnership arrangements, where control may be shared with unaffiliated third parties. as with most joint venture arrangements, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, and we typically have joint and several liability with our joint venture partners under the applicable contracts for joint venture projects. these factors could potentially adversely impact the business and operations of a joint venture and, in turn, our business and operations.         operating through joint ventures in which we are minority holders results in us having limited control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects. of the joint ventures noted above, approximately 7% of our fiscal 2012 revenue was derived from our unconsolidated joint ventures where we generally do not have control of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. as a result, internal control problems may arise with respect to these joint ventures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. misconduct by our employees or consultants or our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business could cause us to lose customers or lose our ability to contract with government agencies.         as a government contractor, misconduct, fraud or other improper activities caused by our employees' or consultants' failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, and anti-corruption, export control and other applicable laws or regulations. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, misconduct by any of our employees or consultants or our failure to make timely and accurate certifications to government agencies regarding misconduct or potential misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of government granted eligibility, cancellation of contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, any of which may adversely affect our business. our defined benefit plans have significant deficits that could grow in the future and cause us to incur additional costs.         we have defined benefit pension plans for employees in the united states, united kingdom, australia, ireland, and canada. at september 30, 2012, our defined benefit pension plans had an aggregate deficit (the excess of projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets) of 17 table of contents approximately $192.2 million. in the future, our pension deficits may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan performance and other factors. because the current economic environment has resulted in declining investment returns and interest rates, we may be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost to satisfy our funding requirements. if we are forced or elect to make up all or a portion of the deficit for unfunded benefit plans, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. new legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results.         our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by the passage of u.s. health care reform, climate change, and other environmental legislation and regulations. currently, we are assessing the impact that health care reform could have on our employer-sponsored medical plans. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services. however, these changes could also increase the pace of development of other projects, which could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. failure to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may inhibit our growth.         we have grown in part as a result of our acquisitions over the last several years, and we expect continued growth in the form of additional acquisitions and expansion into new markets. if we are unable to pursue suitable acquisition opportunities, as a result of global economic uncertainty or other factors, our growth may be inhibited. we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions or investment opportunities will continue to be identified or that any of these transactions can be consummated on favorable terms or at all. any future acquisitions will involve various inherent risks, such as:  our ability to accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;  the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;  increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;  liabilities related to pre-acquisition activities of an acquired business and the burdens on our staff and resources to comply with, conduct or resolve investigations into such activities;  post-acquisition integration challenges; and  post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges.         furthermore, during the acquisition process and thereafter, our management may need to assume significant transaction-related responsibilities, which may cause them to divert their attention from our existing operations. if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. our ability to grow and to compete in our industry will be harmed if we do not retain the continued services of our key technical and management personnel and identify, hire, and retain additional qualified personnel.         there is strong competition for qualified technical and management personnel in the sectors in which we compete. we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified technical and management 18 table of contents personnel, such as engineers, architects and project managers, who are necessary for the development of our business or to replace qualified personnel. our planned growth may place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of technical and management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. also, some of our personnel hold government granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. our revenue and growth prospects may be harmed if we or our employees are unable to obtain government granted eligibility or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.         a number of government programs require contractors to have certain kinds of government granted eligibility. depending on the project, eligibility can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. if we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary eligibility, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. to the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue or profit anticipated from such contract. our industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively, which could result in reduced revenue, profitability and market share.         we are engaged in a highly competitive business. the professional technical and management support services markets we serve are highly fragmented and we compete with a large number of regional, national and international companies. certain of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. others are smaller and more specialized, and concentrate their resources in particular areas of expertise. the extent of our competition varies according to the particular markets and geographic area. the degree and type of competition we face is also influenced by the type and scope of a particular project. our clients make competitive determinations based upon qualifications, experience, performance, reputation, technology, customer relationships and ability to provide the relevant services in a timely, safe and cost-efficient manner. increased competition may result in our inability to win bids for future projects and loss of revenue, profitability and market share. if we extend a significant portion of our credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high levels of collection risk and nonpayment if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry.         our clients include public and private entities that have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the changing landscape in the global economy. while outside of the u.s. federal government no one client accounts for over 10% of our revenue, we face collection risk as a normal part of our business where we perform services and subsequently bill our clients for such services. in the event that we have concentrated credit risk from clients in a specific geographic area or industry, continuing negative trends or a worsening in the financial condition of that specific geographic area or industry could make us susceptible to disproportionately high levels of default by those clients. such defaults could materially adversely impact our revenues and our results of operations. our services expose us to significant risks of liability and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.         our services involve significant risks of professional and other liabilities that may substantially exceed the fees that we derive from our services. in addition, we sometimes contractually assume liability under indemnification agreements. we cannot predict the magnitude of potential liabilities from the operation of our business. 19 table of contents         our professional liability policies cover only claims made during the term of the policy. additionally, our insurance policies may not protect us against potential liability due to various exclusions in the policies and self-insured retention amounts. partially or completely uninsured claims, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business. our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, thus, may not accurately reflect future revenue and profits.         at september 30, 2012, our contracted backlog was approximately $8.5 billion and our awarded backlog was approximately $7.5 billion for a total backlog of $16.0 billion. our contracted backlog includes revenue we expect to record in the future from signed contracts and, in the case of a public sector client, where the project has been funded. our awarded backlog includes revenue we expect to record in the future where we have been awarded the work, but the contractual agreement has not yet been signed. we cannot guarantee that future revenue will be realized from either category of backlog or, if realized, will result in profits. many projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time because of the size or long-term nature of the contract. in addition, from time to time, projects are delayed, scaled back or cancelled. these types of backlog reductions adversely affect the revenue and profits that we ultimately receive from contracts reflected in our backlog. we have submitted claims to clients for work we performed beyond the initial scope of some of our contracts. if these clients do not approve these claims, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.         we typically have pending claims submitted under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements for which we have already recorded revenue. in general, we cannot guarantee that such claims will be approved in whole, in part, or at all. if these claims are not approved, our revenue may be reduced in future periods. in conducting our business, we depend on other contractors and subcontractors. if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our revenue, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.         we depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract. in addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized and/or we could be held responsible for such failures.         we also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or joint venture relationships with us, or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors' programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. in addition, due to "pay when paid" provisions that are common in subcontracts in certain countries, including the u.s., we could experience delays in receiving payment if the prime contractor experiences payment delays. if clients use our reports or other work product without appropriate disclaimers or in a misleading or incomplete manner, our business could be adversely affected.         the reports and other work product we produce for clients sometimes include projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements. such information by its nature is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause the information produced by us to ultimately prove inaccurate. 20 table of contents while we include appropriate disclaimers in the reports that we prepare for our clients, once we produce such written work product, we have no ability to control the manner in which our clients use such information. as a result, if our clients reproduce such information to solicit funds from investors for projects without appropriate disclaimers and the information proves to be incorrect, or if our clients reproduce such information for potential investors in a misleading or incomplete manner, our clients or such investors may threaten to or file suit against us for, among other things, securities law violations. if we were found to be liable for any claims related to our client work product, our business could be adversely affected. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.         we experience seasonal trends in our business with our revenue typically being higher in the last half of the fiscal year. our fourth quarter (july 1 to september 30) typically is our strongest quarter, and our first quarter is typically our weakest quarter. our quarterly revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, including:  the spending cycle of our public sector clients;  employee hiring and utilization rates;  the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;  the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalties;  the ability of our project managers to accurately estimate the percentage of the project completed;  delays incurred as a result of weather conditions;  delays incurred in connection with an engagement;  the size and scope of engagements;  the timing and magnitude of expenses incurred for, or savings realized from, corporate initiatives;  changes in foreign currency rates;  the seasonality of our business;  the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets; and  general economic and political conditions.         variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.         because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets-net represent a substantial portion of our assets. goodwill and intangible assets-net were $1.9 billion as of september 30, 2012. under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach and whenever events occur that indicate impairment could exist. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, a significant sustained decline in our market capitalization and other factors. in connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing for fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $336 million due to market conditions and business trends within the europe, middle east, and africa (emea) and mss reporting units. 21 table of contents         if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an additional impairment charge. in addition, if a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization continues over a sustained period, we would have to record an impairment charge in the future. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. if we are unable to continue to access credit on acceptable terms, our business may be adversely affected.         the state of the global credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, replace our existing credit agreement on or before its expiration in 2016 or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. we use credit facilities to support our working capital and acquisition needs. there is no guarantee that we can continue to renew our credit facility on terms as favorable as those in our existing credit facility and, if we are unable to do so, our costs of borrowing and our business may be adversely affected. our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants and financial ratio tests that restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions. if we fail to comply with these covenants or tests, our indebtedness under these agreements could become accelerated, which could adversely affect us.         our debt agreements, including our senior credit facility and the agreement governing our senior notes, contain various covenants that may have the effect of limiting, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: merge with other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a change in control, create new liens, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business, enter into transactions with affiliates (other than subsidiaries) or substantially change the general nature of our and our subsidiaries' business, taken as a whole, and, in the case of our senior credit facility, make certain investments, enter into restrictive agreements, or make certain dividends or other distributions. these restrictions could limit our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other opportunities, to fund our business operations or to fully implement our current and future operating strategies.         all of our debt agreements relating to our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term credit agreements require us to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter. the agreement governing our senior notes also requires us to maintain a net worth above a calculated threshold. as of september 30, 2012, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.15, which did not exceed our most restrictive maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0. as of september 30, 2012, our net worth was $2.2 billion, which exceeds the calculated threshold of $1.5 billion. our ability to continue to meet these financial ratios and tests will be dependent upon our future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control (including factors discussed in this "risk factors" section). if we fail to satisfy these requirements, our indebtedness under these agreements could become accelerated and payable at a time when we are unable to pay them. this would adversely affect our ability to implement our operating strategies and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate.         we rely heavily on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. if we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems, the operation of our systems could be interrupted or delayed. our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism and similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, or delay or prevent operations, and adversely affect our operating results. 22 table of contents         in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. we rely on industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our information systems . we have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. failure to adequately protect, maintain, or enforce our rights in our intellectual property may adversely limit our competitive position.         our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. we rely on a combination of intellectual property policies and other contractual arrangements to protect much of our intellectual property where we do not believe that trademark, patent or copyright protection is appropriate or obtainable. trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or the infringement of our patents and copyrights. further, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. failure to adequately protect, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights may adversely limit our competitive position. our charter documents contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control.         provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. these provisions include the following:  division of our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  removal of directors for cause only;  ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock in series without stockholder approval;  two-thirds stockholder vote requirement to approve specified business combinations, which include a sale of substantially all of our assets;  vesting of exclusive authority in our board of directors to determine the size of the board (subject to limited exceptions) and to fill vacancies;  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors; and  prohibitions on our stockholders from acting by written consent and limitations on calling special meetings. item 1b.    unresolved
