item 1a. risk factors an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the material risks described below,  together with the other information contained in this form 10-k, before making a decision to invest in our securities. if any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. in that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. this form 10-k also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and may not be able to successfully operate our business or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders. we were organized in 2008 and began investment activity in november, 2009. we have a limited operating history on which to evaluate the current and past performance of arrm and its key personnel, and should not be viewed as an indication of future performance. the results of our operations depend on many factors, including, without limitation: · the availability of opportunities for the acquisition of attractively priced agency securities; · the level and volatility of interest rates; · the availability of readily accessible funding in the financial markets; · our ability to cost-effectively hedge risks; and · overall and general economic conditions. we may not be able to maintain any agreements with our lenders on favorable terms or at all. furthermore, we may not be able to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and strategies as described in this form 10-k, which would harm our financial results and could result in the loss of some or all of your investment. volatile market conditions for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets may adversely affect the value of the assets in which we invest. our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets, including mortgage-backed securities, as well as the broader financial markets and the economy generally. beginning in 2007, significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system and the forced sale of large quantities of mortgage-related and other financial assets. more recently, concerns over economic recession, inflation, geopolitical issues, unemployment, the availability and cost of financing, the mortgage market and a declining real estate market have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets. in particular, the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions, including defaults, credit losses and liquidity concerns. certain commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the residential mortgage market. these factors have impacted investor perception of the risk associated with residential mortgage backed securities, real estate-related securities and various other asset classes in which we may invest. as a result, values for residential mortgage backed securities, real estate-related securities and various other asset classes in which we may invest have experienced volatility. any decline in the value of our investments, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, 9 would likely make it difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place. further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and mortgage backed securities markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of our investments. continued adverse developments in the global capital markets, including defaults, credit losses and liquidity concerns, as well as mergers, acquisitions or bankruptcies of potential repurchase agreement counterparties, could make it difficult for us to borrow money to acquire agency securities on a leveraged basis, on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our profitability. we rely on the availability of financing to acquire agency securities on a leveraged basis. institutions from which we obtain financing may have invested in or financed mortgage backed securities and other assets that have declined in value as a result of the recent downturn in the residential mortgage market, causing these institutions to suffer losses. if these conditions persist, these institutions may be forced to exit the repurchase market, become insolvent or further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital or the weighted average margin requirement, or the percentage amount by which the collateral value must exceed the loan amount required to obtain financing. under such circumstances, it could be more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. our profitability may be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain cost-effective financing for our investments. while the overall financing environment has improved over the last several months, further credit losses or mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcies of investment banks and commercial banks that have historically acted as repurchase agreement counterparties may occur. this would result in a fewer number of potential repurchase agreement counterparties operating in the market and could potentially impact the pricing and availability of financing for our business.   continued adverse developments in the residential mortgage market may adversely affect the value of the agency securities in which we invest. during the past few years, the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions that adversely affected the performance and market value of the agency securities in which we invest. agency securities originated in 2006 and 2007 have experienced a higher and earlier than expected rate of delinquencies. additionally, other earlier vintages of agency securities may not be performing as expected. as a result, the market for these securities may be adversely affected for a significant period of time. conditions within the market are being driven primarily by: · delinquencies across a broad scope of mortgage loans that include subprime1 mortgage loans, alt-a2 mortgage loans, and prime3 mortgage loans. · declining housing prices and flattening of property values, · resetting adjustable rate mortgages that result in increased mortgage payments, and · constrained ability by borrowers to refinance or sell their properties. while we intend to primarily invest in agency securities, rising levels of delinquencies could negatively affect the value of our agency securities or create market uncertainty about their true value. at the same time, market uncertainty about residential mortgages in general could depress the market for agency securities, making it more difficult for us to sell agency securities we own on favorable terms or at all.                                                            1   loans that are made to borrowers with impaired credit 2   loans that are made to borrowers with limited documentation 3   loans that are made to borrowers with excellent credit who provide full documentation the federal conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal government, may adversely affect our business. the payments we receive on the agency securities in which we invest depend upon a steady stream of payments by borrowers on the underlying mortgages and the fulfillment of guarantees by ginnie mae, fannie mae and freddie mac. ginnie mae is part of a u.s. government agency and its guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. fannie mae and freddie mac are u.s. government-sponsored entities, but their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. 10 since 2007, fannie mae and freddie mac have reported substantial losses and a need for substantial amounts of additional capital. in response to the deteriorating financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac and the credit market disruption, congress and the u.s. treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these government-sponsored entities and the financial markets, generally. the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 was signed into law on july 30, 2008, and established the federal housing finance agency (fhfa), with enhanced regulatory authority over, among other things, the business activities of fannie mae and freddie mac and the size of their portfolio holdings. on september 7, 2008, fhfa placed fannie mae and freddie mac into federal conservatorship and, together with the u.s. treasury, established a program designed to boost investor confidence in fannie maes and freddie macs debt and agency securities. as the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac, the fhfa controls and directs the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac and may (1) take over the assets of and operate fannie mae and freddie mac with all the powers of the shareholders, the directors, and the officers of fannie mae and freddie mac and conduct all business of fannie mae and freddie mac; (2) collect all obligations and money due to fannie mae and freddie mac; (3) perform all functions of fannie mae and freddie mac which are consistent with the conservators appointment; (4) preserve and conserve the assets and property of fannie mae and freddie mac; and (5) contract for assistance in fulfilling any function, activity, action or duty of the conservator. those efforts resulted in significant u.s. government financial support and increased control of the government sponsored enterprises (gses). in december 2010, the fhfa reported that, from the time of execution of the preferred stock purchase agreements through september 30, 2010, funding provided to fannie mae and freddie mac under the preferred stock purchase agreements amounted to approximately $88 billion and $63 billion, respectively. the u.s. treasury has committed to support the positive net worth of fannie mae and freddie mac, through preferred stock purchases as necessary, through 2012. those agreements, as amended, also require the reduction of fannie maes and freddie macs mortgage and agency securities portfolios (they were limited to $900 billion as of december 31, 2009, and to $810 billion as of december 31, 2010, and must be reduced each year until their respective mortgage assets reach $250 billion). both the secured short-term credit facility and the agency securities program initiated by the u.s. treasury expired on december 31, 2009. however, through that securities purchase program (from september 2008 through december 2009), the u.s. treasury acquired approximately $220 billion of agency securities. in addition, while the u.s. federal reserves program of agency securities purchases terminated in 2010, the fhfa reported that through january 2010, the u.s. federal reserve had purchased $1.03 trillion net of agency securities. subject to specified investment guidelines, the portfolios of agency securities purchased through the programs established by the u.s. treasury and the u.s. federal reserve may be held to maturity and, based on mortgage market conditions, adjustments may be made to these portfolios. this flexibility may adversely affect the pricing and availability of agency securities that we seek to acquire during the remaining term of these portfolios. although the u.s. government has committed to support the positive net worth of fannie mae and freddie mac through 2012, there can be no assurance that these actions will be adequate for their needs. these uncertainties lead to questions about the availability of, and trading market for, agency securities. despite the steps taken by the u.s. government, fannie mae and freddie mac could default on their guarantee obligations which would materially and adversely affect the value of our agency securities. accordingly, if these government actions are inadequate and the gses continue to suffer losses or cease to exist, our business, operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, the problems faced by fannie mae and freddie mac, resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant u.s. government support, have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the u.s. government in providing liquidity for mortgage loans. the future roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited, relative to historical measurements. alternatively, fannie mae and freddie mac could be dissolved or privatized, and the u.s. government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market. any changes to the nature of their guarantee obligations could redefine what constitutes an agency security and could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition. if fannie mae or freddie mac were eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guarantee obligation), we may be unable to acquire additional agency securities and our existing agency securities could be materially and adversely impacted. we could be negatively affected in a number of ways depending on the manner in which related events unfold for fannie mae and freddie mac. we rely on our agency securities as collateral for our financings under our repurchase agreements. any decline in their value or perceived market uncertainty about their value, would make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on our agency securities on acceptable terms or at all, or to maintain our compliance with the terms of any financing transactions. further, the current support provided by the u.s. treasury to fannie mae and freddie mac, and any additional support it may provide in the future, could have the effect of lowering the interest rates we expect to receive from agency securities, thereby tightening the spread between the interest we earn on our agency securities and the cost of financing those assets. a reduction in the supply of agency securities could also negatively affect the pricing of agency securities, by reducing the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio of agency securities and our cost of financing that portfolio. 11 as indicated above, recent legislation has changed the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. government. future legislation could further change the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. government, and could also nationalize, privatize, or eliminate such entities entirely. any law affecting these gses may create market uncertainty and have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac. as a result, such laws could increase the risk of loss on our investments in agency securities guaranteed by fannie mae and/or freddie mac. it also is possible that such laws could adversely impact the market for such securities and spreads at which they trade. all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. mortgage loan modification programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, the agency securities in which we invest. the u.s. government, through the federal reserve, the federal housing administration (fha) and the federal deposit insurance corporation, has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including the home affordable modification program (hamp), which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, the hope for homeowners program (h4h program), which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fha-insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and the home affordable refinance program, which allows borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments to refinance and reduce their monthly mortgage payments at loan-to-value ratios up to 125 percent without new mortgage insurance. hamp, the h4h program and other loss mitigation programs may involve among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or to extend the payment terms of the loans. especially with non-agency securities, a significant number of loan modifications with respect to a given security, including, but not limited to, those related to principal forgiveness and coupon reduction, could negatively impact the realized yields and cash flows on such security. these loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our agency securities. we may not be able to operate our business or implement our operating policies and strategies successfully. the results of our operations depend on many factors, including, without limitation, the availability of opportunities for the acquisition of attractively priced agency securities, the level and volatility of interest rates, readily accessible funding  in the financial markets and our ability to cost-effectively hedge risks as well as overall economic conditions. we may not be able to maintain any agreements with our lenders on favorable terms or at all. furthermore, we may not be able to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and strategies as described in this form 10-k, which could result in the loss of some or all of your investment. increased levels of prepayments from mortgage backed securities may decrease our net interest income or result in a net loss. pools of mortgage loans underlie the agency securities that we acquire. we generally receive payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans. when we acquire agency securities, we anticipate that the underlying mortgages will prepay at a projected rate generating an expected yield. when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the related prepayments on the corresponding agency securities will be faster than expected.  since we typically purchase agency securities at premium prices that reflect above market coupons, faster-than-expected prepayments reduce the period those above market coupons are outstanding and could potentially harm our financial position and results of operations.   furthermore, while the agency securities we purchase are guaranteed against principal loss by fannie mae, freddie mac, or ginnie mae, defaults, serious delinquencies, and loan modifications of the underlying mortgages result in prepayment of principal as well. continuing poor credit results at fannie mae, freddie mac, and ginnie mae would suggest higher rates of prepayments from defaults and serious delinquencies.  while we will seek to manage prepayment risk, in selecting investments, we must balance prepayment risk against other risks, the potential returns of each investment and the cost of hedging its risks. no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks, and we may deliberately retain exposure to prepayment or other risks. recent market conditions may upset the historical relationship between interest rate changes and prepayment trends, which would make it more difficult for us to analyze our portfolio. our success depends on our ability to analyze the relationship of changing interest rates and prepayments of the mortgages that underlie our agency securities. changes in interest rates and prepayments affect the market price of the agency securities that we purchase and any agency securities that we hold at a given time. as part of our overall portfolio risk management, we analyze interest rate changes and prepayment trends separately and collectively to assess their effects on our portfolio. in conducting our 12 analysis, we depend on industry-accepted assumptions with respect to the relationship between interest rates and prepayments under normal market conditions. if the dislocation in the residential mortgage market or other developments change the way that prepayment trends have historically responded to interest rate changes, our ability to assess the market value of our portfolio would be significantly affected and could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. actions of the u.s. government, including the u.s. congress, federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing or reforming the financial markets, or market response to those actions, may not achieve the intended effect or benefit our business, and may adversely affect our business. in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions, the emergency economic stabilization act (or eesa), was enacted by the u.s. congress in 2008. there can be no assurance that the eesa or any other u.s. government actions will have a beneficial impact on the financial markets. to the extent the markets do not respond favorably to any such actions by the u.s. government or such actions do not function as intended, our business may not receive the anticipated positive impact from the legislation and such result may have broad adverse market implications. in july 2010, the u.s. congress enacted the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (or the dodd-frank act), in part to impose significant investment restrictions and capital requirements on banking entities and other organizations that are significant to u.s. financial markets. for instance, the dodd-frank act will impose significant restrictions on the proprietary trading activities of certain banking entities and subject other systemically significant organizations regulated by the u.s. federal reserve to increased capital requirements and quantitative limits for engaging in such activities. the dodd-frank act also seeks to reform the asset-backed securitization market (including the agency securities market) by requiring the retention of a portion of the credit risk inherent in the pool of securitized assets and by imposing additional registration and disclosure requirements. certain of the new requirements and restrictions exempt agency securities, other government issued or guaranteed securities, or other securities. nonetheless, the dodd-frank act also imposes significant regulatory restrictions on the origination of residential mortgage loans. while the full impact of the dodd-frank act cannot be assessed until implementing regulations are released, the dodd-frank acts extensive requirements may have a significant effect on the financial markets, and may affect the availability or terms of financing from our lender counterparties and the availability or terms of agency securities, both of which may have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, u.s. government, federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what affect, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the increasing number of proposed u.s. federal, state and local laws and regulations may affect certain mortgage-related assets in which we intend to invest and could increase our cost of doing business. legislation has been proposed which, among other provisions, could hinder the ability of a servicer to foreclose promptly on defaulted mortgage loans or would permit limited assignee liability for certain violations in the mortgage loan origination process. for example, the dodd-frank act permits borrowers to assert certain defenses to foreclosure against an assignee for certain violations in the mortgage loan origination process. we cannot predict whether or in what form the u.s. congress, the various state and local legislatures or the various federal, state or local regulatory agencies may enact legislation affecting our business. we will evaluate the potential impact of any initiatives which, if enacted, could affect our practices and results of operations. we are unable to predict whether the u.s. federal, state or local authorities will enact laws, rules or regulations that will require changes in our practices in the future and any such changes could adversely affect our cost of doing business and profitability. changes in interest rates may adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial position. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, all of which are beyond our control. our success depends on our ability to analyze the relationship changing interest rates may have on our results of operations and financial position in general, and the impact such rate changes may have on critical elements underlying agency securities and other investments values and borrowings in particular, as follows: · changes in interest rates may inversely affect the fair market value of our assets, which are primarily agency securities. when interest rates rise, the value of fixed-rate agency securities generally declines, when interest rates fall, the value of fixed-rate agency securities generally increase. 13 · changes in interest rates may inversely affect levels of prepayments on mortgages. typically, as interest rates rise, prepayments on the underlying mortgages tend to slow; conversely, as interest rates fall, prepayments on the underlying mortgages tend to accelerate. the effect that rising or falling interest rates has on these prepayments affects the price of agency securities and the effect can be particularly pronounced with fixed rate agency securities. · changes in interest rates may create mismatches between our assets, primarily agency securities, and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of those assets. the risk of these mismatches may be pronounced in that, should rates increase, interest rate caps on our hybrid adjustable rate and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities would limit the income stream on these investments while our borrowings would not be subject to similar restrictions. interest rate fluctuations will also cause variations in the yield curve, which may reduce our net income. the relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the yield curve. if short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates (a flattening of the yield curve), our borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. because our assets may bear interest based on longer-term rates than our borrowings, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease our net income and the market value of our agency security assets. additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested in agency securities, the spread between the yields of the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease our net income. it is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve inversion), in which event our borrowing costs may exceed our interest income and we could incur significant operating losses. this risk and the variables created by changing interest rates discussed above are integral to our business and our investment strategies. we will seek to mitigate these risks to the degree achievable through the active formulation and execution of our hedging strategies. interest rate mismatches between our agency securities and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of these securities may reduce our income during periods of changing interest rates. historically, we have funded most of our investments in adjustable-rate agency securities with borrowings that have interest rates that adjust more frequently than the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our agency securities. accordingly, if short-term interest rates increase, our borrowing costs may increase faster than the interest rates on our adjustable-rate securities adjust. as a result, in a period of rising interest rates, we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss. our investment strategy focuses on the acquisition of adjustable-rate agency securities. this means that their interest rates may vary over time based upon changes in an identified short-term interest rate index. in most cases, the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the agency securities that we acquire and our borrowings will not be identical, thereby potentially creating an interest rate mismatch between our investments and our borrowings. while the historical spread between relevant short-term interest rate indices has been relatively stable, there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile. during periods of changing interest rates, these interest rate index mismatches could reduce our net income or produce a net loss, and adversely affect our dividends and the market price of our common stock. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. interest rate caps on our adjustable rate agency securities may reduce our income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. the mortgage loans underlying our adjustable rate securities typically will be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. additionally, we may invest in adjustable rate mortgages (arms), with an initial teaser rate that will provide us with a lower than market interest rate initially, which may accordingly have lower interest rate caps than arms without such teaser rates. periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during a given period. lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through maturity of a mortgage loan. if these interest rate caps apply to the mortgage loans underlying our adjustable rate securities, the interest distributions made on the related securities will be similarly impacted. our borrowings may not be subject to similar interest rate caps. accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps would limit the interest distributions on our adjustable rate agency securities. further, some of the mortgage loans underlying our adjustable rate agency securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest on those loans being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. as a result, we could receive less interest distributions on adjustable rate agency securities, particularly those with an initial teaser rate, than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. these, factors could lower our net interest income, cause us to suffer a net loss or cause us to incur additional borrowings to fund interest payments during periods of rising interest rates or sell our investments at a loss. 14 because we may acquire fixed-rate securities, an increase in interest rates may adversely affect our book value. increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our agency securities. any fixed rate securities we invest in generally will be more negatively affected by these increases than adjustable rate securities. in accordance with accounting rules, we are required to reduce our shareholders equity, or book value, by the amount of any decrease in the market value of our mortgage related assets. we are required to evaluate our securities on a quarterly basis to determine their fair value by using third party bid price indications provided by dealers who make markets in these securities or by third party pricing services. if the fair value of a security is not available from a dealer or third party price service, we estimate the fair value of the security using a variety of methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow analysis, matrix pricing, option-adjusted spread models and fundamental analysis. aggregate characteristics taken into consideration include, but are not limited to, type of collateral, index, margin, periodic cap, lifetime cap, underwriting standards, age and delinquency experience. however, the fair value reflects estimates and may not be indicative of the amounts we would receive in a current market exchange. if we are required by accounting rules to reduce the value of one or more agency securities on our balance sheet then our shareholders equity would be correspondingly reduced. reductions in shareholders equity decrease the amounts we may borrow to purchase additional securities, which could restrict our ability to increase our net income. mitigating against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings, and our interest rate risk mitigation transactions  may fail to protect us from the losses that they were designed to offset. subject to complying with reit tax requirements, we employ techniques that limit the adverse effects of rising interest rates on a portion of our short-term repurchase agreements and on a portion of the value of our assets. in general, our interest rate mitigation strategy depends on our view of our entire portfolio, consisting of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments, in light of prevailing market conditions. we could misjudge the condition of our portfolio or the market. our interest rate risk mitigation activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates and principal repayments, the type of securities held and other changing market conditions. our actual interest rate risk mitigation decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our currently anticipated strategy. these techniques may include purchasing or selling futures contracts, entering into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements, swaptions, purchasing put and call options on securities or securities underlying futures contracts, or entering into forward rate agreements. because a mortgage borrower typically has no restrictions on when a loan may be paid off, either partially or in full, there are no perfect interest rate risk mitigation strategies, and interest rate mitigation may fail to protect us from loss. alternatively, we may fail to properly assess a risk to our portfolio or may fail to recognize a risk entirely leaving us exposed to losses without the benefit of any offsetting interest rate mitigation activities. the derivative instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. the nature and timing of interest rate risk mitigation transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. in addition, interest rate risk mitigation activities could result in losses if the event against which we mitigate does not occur. we may not be able to execute desired interest risk mitigation transactions at favorable prices. we will continue to execute derivative instrument transactions to manage many, but not all, of the risks inherent in our portfolio. this strategy will potentially help us reduce our exposure to significant changes in interest rates but entails significant costs and other risks. these derivative instruments may not be attractively priced in the marketplace and may not be available to us given our financial condition in the future or as a result of other factors. additionally, we may not successfully implement our business strategy, we may expose ourselves to additional risks and we could suffer significant losses. our use of derivative instruments may expose us to counterparty risk. we enter into transactions to mitigate interest rate risks associated with our business with counterparties that have a high-quality credit rating and with futures exchanges. if counterparties, or the exchange, cannot perform under the terms of our futures contracts, for example, we would not receive payments due under that agreement, and may lose any unrealized gain associated with the futures contract, and the mitigated liability would cease to be mitigated by the futures contract. we may also be at risk for any collateral we have pledged to secure our obligations under the futures contract if the counterparty became insolvent or filed for bankruptcy. similarly, if a counterparty to a cap agreement fails to perform under the terms of the agreement, in addition to not receiving payments due under that agreement that would offset our interest expense, we would also incur a loss for all remaining unamortized premium paid for that agreement. our derivative instrument agreements require our counterparties to post collateral in certain events, generally related to their credit condition, to provide us some protection against their potential failure to perform. we, in turn, are subject to similar requirements. 15 competition may prevent us from acquiring agency securities at favorable yields and that would harm our results of operations. our net income largely depends on our ability to acquire agency securities at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. in acquiring agency securities, we compete with other reits, investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, other lenders and other entities that purchase agency securities, many of which have greater financial resources than we do. additionally, many of our competitors are not subject to reit tax compliance or required to maintain an exemption from the 1940 act. as a result, we may not be able to acquire sufficient agency securities at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs, which would harm our results of operations. we may be harmed by changes in various laws and regulation. our business may be harmed by changes in laws and regulations affecting it, including changes to securities laws and changes to the code applicable to the taxation of reits. in addition, proposed changes to laws and regulation that could hinder a loan servicers ability to adjust loan interest rates upward or to foreclose promptly on defaulted mortgage loans could adversely affect the performance of the loans and the yield on and value of the mortgage securities. any legislation requiring u.s. government-chartered entities to reduce the amount of mortgages they own or for which they guarantee payments on agency securities could adversely affect the availability and pricing of agency securities and harm our business. new legislation may be enacted into law or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, any of which could harm us and our stockholders, potentially with retroactive effect. we may not be able to acquire investments at favorable prices. we may not be able to acquire agency securities at favorable prices. as a result, we may not be able to acquire enough agency securities in order to remain fully invested, or we may have to pay more for agency securities than we would expect. in either case, the return that we earn on our stockholders equity may be reduced.    risks related to debt financing there is no assurance that our current financing arrangements will remain in place. during the credit crisis which began in 2007, and which continues to this day, repurchase funding became increasingly more difficult to acquire. our relationship with avm, l.p. (avm), a securities broker dealer which we contract for clearing and settlement services for our securities and derivative transactions, as well as assistance with financing transaction services such as repurchase financing and management of margin arrangements between us and our lenders for each of our repurchase agreements, is beneficial in addressing the potential scarcity of repurchase funding. nonetheless we will depend on borrowings to fund our acquisitions of agency securities and reach our target leverage ratio. accordingly, our ability to achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms. currently, we have entered into several master agreements establishing the terms and conditions of borrowings, if any, made by lenders. there can be no assurance that these agreements will remain in place and, even if in place, the amount and definitive terms under which we would be able to borrow. continued adverse developments in the residential and commercial mortgage markets could make it more difficult for us to borrow money to finance our acquisition of residential agency securities. institutions from which we seek to obtain financing may also originate and hold residential and commercial mortgage loans and may have suffered financial difficulties as a result of the market conditions described above. further, even lenders that do not originate and hold mortgage loans may have suffered losses related to their lending and other financial relationships with the institutions that do so as part of their businesses. as a result, institutions that originate and hold loans, and other lenders that have been indirectly affected by losses in the mortgage market, may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards which could result in the following: · our lenders may not be able to obtain financing to fund our borrowings; · our lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations; · we may not be able to fund acquisitions of sufficient agency securities to reach our target leverage ratio; · we may become dependent on one or a few lenders for all of our financing; and · our size may impact our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. 16 we may incur increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements which could harm our results of operations. our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements that we have arranged generally are adjustable and relate to short-term interest rates, such as the london interbank offered rate (libor). the price of these borrowings may vary depending upon a number of factors, including, without limitation: · the movement of interest rates; · the availability of financing in the market, including the financial stability of lenders; and · the value and liquidity of our agency securities. we expect that most of our borrowings will be collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements. if the interest rates on these repurchase agreements increase, our results of operations may be harmed and we may have losses. we leverage our portfolio investments in agency securities, which may adversely affect our return on our investments and may reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders. we leverage our portfolio investments in agency securities through borrowings under repurchase agreements. leverage can enhance our potential returns but can also exacerbate losses. the percentage of leverage will vary depending on our ability to obtain these financing facilities and the lenders and rating agencies estimate of the stability of the portfolio investments cash flow. our return on our investments and cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced if market conditions cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that can be derived from the assets acquired, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. in addition, our debt service payments will reduce cash flow available for distributions to stockholders. we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. to the extent that we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy our debt obligations. our leverage strategy increases the risks of our operations, which could reduce our net income and the amount available for distributions or cause us to suffer a loss. we generally seek to borrow so that our debt-to-equity ratio is between 6:1 and 10:1, but we are not explicitly bound by that range. we incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our agency securities. the amount of leverage, however, is not expressly limited and will depend on our and our lenders estimate of the stability of our portfolios cash flow and our ability to service and repay additional debt. we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations and, to the extent we cannot, we may be forced to liquidate our assets at disadvantageous prices and you could lose some or all of your investment. this leverage, which is fundamental to our investment strategy, also creates significant risks. for example: · our borrowings are secured by our agency securities, generally under repurchase agreements. a decline in the market value of the agency securities used to secure these debt obligations could limit our ability to borrow or result in lenders requiring us to pledge additional collateral to secure our borrowings. in that situation, we could be required to sell agency securities under adverse market conditions. if these sales are made at prices lower than the carrying value of the agency securities, we would experience losses; · certain lenders may require us to remain in compliance with all provisions of other material contracts, including other financing agreements. as a result, a default under one financing agreement could cause us to be in default under other financing agreements. if that occurs, our access to capital would be significantly impeded, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business; and · to the extent we are compelled to liquidate qualified reit assets to repay debts, our compliance with the reit rules regarding our assets and our sources of income could be negatively affected, which would jeopardize our qualification as a reit. losing our reit status would cause us to lose tax advantages applicable to reits and would decrease our overall profitability and distributions to our stockholders. · in addition, certain of our master repurchase agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding twelve times our stockholders equity. if we experience losses as a result of our leverage policy, such losses would reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. because the assets that we expect to acquire may experience periods of illiquidity, we may be prevented from selling our agency securities at opportune times and prices. 17 we bear the risk of being unable to dispose of our agency securities at advantageous times and prices or in a timely manner because agency securities may experience periods of illiquidity. the lack of liquidity may result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale. as a result, the illiquidity of agency securities may harm our results of operations and could cause us to suffer a loss and reduce our distributions. risks related to our corporate structure we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future. we intend to continue to make regular cash distributions to our shareholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments, is distributed. this, along with other factors, should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the code. however, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this report. all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time. there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future. in addition, some of our distributions may include a return of capital. although we have no intention to do so, we may use proceeds from equity and debt offerings and other financings to fund distributions, which will decrease the amount of capital available for purchasing our target assets. we presently have no intention of using the proceeds of any offering of our equity or debt or other financings to fund distributions to stockholders. however, there are no restrictions in our charter or in any agreement to which we are a party that prohibits us from doing so. in the event that we elect to fund any distribution to our stockholders from sources other than our earnings, the amount of capital available to us to purchase our target assets would decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our overall financial results and performance. maintenance of our exemption from the 1940 act will impose limits on our business. we conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 act. if we were to fall within the definition of investment company, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in this form 10-k. section 3(a) (1) (a) of the 1940 act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. section 3(a) (1) (c) of the 1940 act also defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuers total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. excluded from the term investment securities, among other things, in section 3(a) (1) (c) of the 1940 act, as defined above, are u.s. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in section 3(c) (1) or section 3(c) (7) of the 1940 act. to avoid registration as an investment company, we rely on the exclusion provided by section 3(c) (5) (c) of the 1940 act. to qualify for the exclusion, we intend to make investments so that at least 55% of the assets we own consist of qualifying assets and so that at least 80% of the assets we own consist of qualifying assets and real estate related assets. we generally expect that our investments in agency securities will be treated as either qualifying assets or real estate related assets under section 3(c)(5)(c) of the 1940 act in a manner consistent with the sec staff no-action letters. qualifying assets for this purpose include mortgage loans and other assets, such as whole pool agency securities that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for purposes of the 1940 act. we invest at least 55% of our assets in whole pool agency securities that constitute qualifying assets in accordance with sec staff guidance and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying interests plus other real estate related assets. other real estate related assets would consist primarily of non-whole pool agency securities and funds awaiting investment. as a result of the foregoing restrictions, we will be limited in our ability to make or dispose of certain investments. to the extent that the sec staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. these restrictions could also result in our holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold. although we monitor our portfolio relying on the section 3(c) (5) (c) exclusion periodically and prior to each acquisition and disposition, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain this exclusion. to the extent that we elect in the future to conduct our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, such business will be conducted in such a manner as to ensure that we do not meet the definition of investment company under either section 3(a)(1)(a) or section 3(a)(1)(c) of the 1940 act. all wholly-owned subsidiaries that we elect to conduct our business through would qualify for the section 3(c)(5)(c) exclusion discussed above and we would, accordingly, qualify for the section 3(a)(1)(c) exemption because less 18 than 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis would consist of investment securities. we monitor our portfolio periodically to insure compliance with the 40% test. in such case, we would be a holding company which conducts business exclusively through wholly-owned subsidiaries and we would be engaged in the non-investment company business of our subsidiaries. loss of our 1940 act exemption would adversely affect us, the market price of shares of our common stock or warrants and our ability to distribute dividends. as described above, we conduct our operations so as not to become required to register as an investment company under the 1940 act based on current laws, regulations and guidance. as described above, we conduct our operations so as not to become required to register as an investment company under the 1940 act based on current laws, regulations and guidance. although we monitor our portfolio, we may not be able to maintain our 1940 act exemption. if we were to fail to qualify for this exemption in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, if any, including effecting sales of assets in a manner that, or at a time when we would not otherwise choose, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock or warrants, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions. the sale could occur during adverse market conditions, and we could be forced to accept a price below that which we believe is appropriate. there are significant restrictions on ownership of our stock and warrants. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code, not more than 50% in value of the issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year (other than our first year as a reit).  this test is known as the 5/50 test.  attribution rules in the code apply to determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our capital stock for purposes of this requirement, including without limitation, a rule that deems a holder of a warrant or option to purchase stock as owning the shares underlying such warrant or option and a rule that treats shares owned (or treated as owned, including shares underlying warrants) by entities in which an individual has a direct or indirect interest as if they were owned by such individual.  additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our capital stock during at least 335 days of each taxable year (other than our first year as a reit).  while we believe that we currently meet the 5/50 test, no assurance can be given that we will continue to meet this test. our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. additionally, our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership of our stock that would otherwise result in our failure to qualify as a reit. in each case, such prohibition includes a prohibition on owning warrants or options to purchase stock if ownership of the underlying stock would cause the holder or beneficial owner to exceed the prohibited thresholds. the ownership rules in our charter are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be owned by one individual or entity. as a result, these ownership rules could cause an individual or entity to unintentionally own shares beneficially or constructively in excess of our ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock or warrants in excess of our ownership limits without the consent of arrm or our board shall be void, and will result in the shares being transferred to a charitable trust. these provisions may inhibit market activity and the resulting opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares that might otherwise exist if any person were to attempt to assemble a block of shares of our stock in excess of the number of shares permitted under our charter and which may be in the best interests of our stockholders. currently, there are holders of our capital stock and/or warrants whose ownership exceeds the thresholds set forth in our charter. we have granted waivers from the 9.8% charter restriction for holders where, based on representations, covenants and agreements received from certain equity holders; we determined that such waivers would not jeopardize our status as a reit.   provisions of maryland law and other provisions of our organizational documents may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the company. certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests. additionally, our charter and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control of the company. if we have a class of equity securities registered under the securities exchange act and meet certain other requirements, title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl permits arrm without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to elect on behalf of the company to be subject to statutory provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. pursuant to title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl, once we meet the applicable requirements, our charter provides that our board will have the exclusive power to fill vacancies on our board. as a result, unless all of the directorships are vacant, our stockholders will not be able to fill vacancies with nominees of their own choosing. arrm may elect to opt in to 19 additional provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl without stockholder approval at any time that we have a class of equity securities registered under the securities exchange act and satisfy certain other requirements. risks related to our management and conflicts of interest we depend on our manager, arrm, and particularly key personnel including mr. ulm and mr. zimmer. the loss of those key personnel could severely and detrimentally affect our operations. as an externally-managed company, we depend on the diligence, experience and skill of our manager for the selection, acquisition, structuring, hedging and monitoring of our mortgage backed assets and associated borrowings. we depend on the efforts and expertise of our operating officers to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. if any of our key personnel were to leave the company, locating individuals with specialized industry knowledge and skills similar to that of our key personnel may not be possible or could take months. because we are a new company with no employees, the loss of mr. ulm and mr. zimmer could harm our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. messrs. ulm and zimmer have a long term relationship with avm and we have a contract with avm to provide clearing and settlement services for our securities and derivative transactions.  we have also entered into a second contract with avm to assist us with financing transaction services such as repurchase financings and managing the margin arrangement between us and our lenders for each of our expected repurchase agreements. we rely on avm for these aspects of our business so our executive officers can focus on our daily operations and strategic direction. further, as our business expands, we will be increasingly dependent on avm to provide us with timely, effective services. in the future, as we expand our staff, we may absorb internally some or all of the services provided by avm.  until we elect to move those services in-house, we will remain dependent on avm or other third parties that provide similar services. if we are unable to maintain a relationship with avm or are unable to establish a successful relationship with other third parties providing similar services at comparable pricing, we may have to reduce or delay our operations and/or increase our expenditures and undertake the repurchase agreement and trading and administrative activities on our own, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. however, we believe that the breadth and scope of our manager's experience will enable them to fill any needs created by discontinuing a relationship with avm. there are conflicts of interest in our relationship with arrm and its affiliates, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders or warrant holders. we are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with arrm and its affiliates. each of our executive officers and certain of our non-independent directors is also an employee or partner of arrm and they will not be exclusively dedicated to our business. each of mr. ulm and mr. zimmer is a partner and owner of equity interests in arrm. in addition, daniel c. staton and marc h. bell, two of our directors, are principal owners of staton bell blank check llc, (sbbc), or sub-manager, which, in consideration for services to be provided to arrm under a sub-management agreement is entitled to receive a percentage of the net management fee earned by arrm from us. as a result, the management agreement with arrm may create a conflict of interest, and its terms, including fees payable to arrm, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. in addition, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the management agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with arrm. arrm maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. the management agreement with arrm does not prevent arrm and its affiliates from engaging in additional management or investment opportunities some of which will compete with us. arrm and its affiliates may engage in additional management or investment opportunities that have overlapping objectives with ours, and may thus face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to these other investments. such allocation is at the discretion of arrm and there is no guarantee that this allocation would be made in the best interest of our stockholders or warrant holders. we are not entitled to receive preferential treatment as compared with the treatment given by arrm or its affiliates to any investment company, fund or advisory account other than any fund or advisory account which contains only funds invested by arrm (and not of any of its clients or customers) or its officers and directors. additionally, the ability of arrm and its respective officers and employees to engage in other business activities may reduce the time spent managing our activities. in the future, we may enter, or arrm may cause us to enter, into additional transactions with arrm or its affiliates. in particular, we may purchase, or arrm may cause us to purchase, assets from arrm or its affiliates or make co-purchases alongside arrm or its affiliates. these transactions may not be the result of arms length negotiations and may involve conflicts between our interests and the interests of arrm and/or its affiliates in obtaining favorable terms and conditions. 20 members of our management team have competing duties to other entities, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders or warrant holders. our executive officers and the employees of arrm do not spend all of their time managing our activities and our investment portfolio. our executive officers and the employees of arrm allocate some, or a material portion, of their time to other businesses and activities. for example, each of our executive officers is also an employee or partner of arrm. none of these individuals is required to devote a specific amount of time to our affairs. accordingly, we compete with arrm, its existing funds, investment vehicles, other ventures and possibly other entities in the future for the time and attention of these officers. if arrm ceases to be our investment manager, financial institutions providing any financing arrangements to us may not provide future financing to us. financial institutions that we seek to finance our investments may require that arrm continue to act in such capacity. if arrm ceases to be our manager, it may constitute an event of default and the financial institution providing the arrangement may have acceleration rights with respect to outstanding borrowings and termination rights with respect to our ability to finance our future investments with that institution. if we are unable to obtain financing for our accelerated borrowings and for our future investments under such circumstances, it is likely that we would be materially and adversely affected. arrms failure to make investments on favorable terms that satisfy our investment strategy and otherwise generate attractive risk-adjusted returns initially and consistently from time to time in the future would materially and adversely affect us. our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on arrms personnel and their ability to make investments on favorable terms that satisfy our investment strategy and otherwise generate attractive risk-adjusted returns initially and consistently from time to time in the future. accomplishing this result is also a function of arrms ability to execute our financing strategy on favorable terms. the manner of determining the management fee may not provide sufficient incentive to arrm to maximize risk-adjusted returns on our investment portfolio since it is based on our gross equity raised and not on our performance. arrm is entitled to receive a monthly management fee that is based on the total of all gross equity raised (as defined in the management agreement), as measured as of the date of determination (i.e., each month), regardless of our performance. accordingly, the possibility exists that significant management fees could be payable to arrm for a given month despite the fact that we could experience a net loss during that month. arrms entitlement to such significant nonperformance-based compensation may not provide sufficient incentive to arrm to devote its time and effort to source and maximize risk-adjusted returns on our investment portfolio, which could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock or warrants. further, the management fee structure gives arrm the incentive to maximize gross equity raised by the issuance of new equity securities or the retention of existing equity, regardless of the effect of these actions on existing stockholders. in other words, the management fee structure will reward arrm primarily based on the size of our equity, and not on our financial returns to stockholders. the termination of the management agreement may be difficult and costly, which may adversely affect our inclination to end our relationship with arrm. termination of the management agreement with arrm without cause is difficult and costly. the term cause is limited to those circumstances described in the management agreement with arrm. the management agreement provides that, in the absence of cause, it may be terminated by us only without cause and only during any renewal term following the initial 5-year term of the management agreement. arrm will be provided 180 days prior notice of any such termination by us without cause. additionally, upon a termination by us without cause, the management agreement provides that we will pay arrm a termination payment equal to three times the sum of the base management fee received by arrm during the twelve month period before such termination, calculated as of the effective date of termination. this provision increases the effective cost to us of electing to terminate the management agreement, thereby adversely affecting our inclination to end our relationship with arrm prior to the expiration of any renewal term, even if we believe arrms performance is not satisfactory. arrm may terminate the management agreement at any time and for any reason upon 180 days prior notice. if the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our business plan. additionally, following the initial 5-year term, the management agreement will automatically renew for successive 1-year renewal terms unless either we or arrm give advance notice to the other of our intent not to renew the agreement prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. however, our right to give such a notice of non-renewal is limited and requires our independent directors to agree that certain conditions are met. 21 arrms liability is limited under the management agreement and we have agreed to indemnify arrm and its affiliates against certain liabilities. as a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which arrm would not be liable. the management agreement limits the liability of arrm and any directors and officers of arrm for money damages, except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. pursuant to the management agreement, arrm will not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for there under and will not be responsible for any action of our board in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. arrm and its affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, equity holders, employees, representatives and agents, and any affiliates thereof, will not be liable to us, our shareholders, any subsidiary of ours, the shareholders of any subsidiary of ours, our board, any issuer of mortgage securities, any credit-party, any counterparty under any agreement, or any other person for any acts or omissions, errors of judgment or mistakes of law by arrm or its affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, equity holders, employees, representatives or agents, or any affiliates thereof, under or in connection with the management agreement, except if arrm was grossly negligent, acted with reckless disregard or engaged in willful misconduct or fraud while discharging its duties under the management agreement. we have agreed to indemnify arrm and its affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, equity holders, employees, representatives and agents, and any affiliates thereof, with respect to all expenses, losses, costs, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature, actual or threatened (including reasonable attorneys fees), arising from or in respect of any acts or omissions, errors of judgment or mistakes of law (or any alleged acts or omissions, errors of judgment or mistakes of law) performed or made while acting in any capacity contemplated under the management agreement or pursuant to any underwriting or similar agreement to which arrm is a party that is related to our activities, unless arrm was grossly negligent, acted with reckless disregard or engaged in willful misconduct or fraud while discharging its duties under the management agreement. as a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which arrm would not be liable. in addition, our articles of incorporation provide that no director or officer of ours shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for money damages. furthermore, our articles of incorporation permit, and our by-laws require, us to indemnify, pay or reimburse any present or former director or officer of ours who is made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of his or her service to us in such capacity. officers and directors of ours who are also officers and board members of arrm will therefore benefit from the exculpation and indemnification provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, and accordingly may not be liable to us in such circumstances. federal income tax risks rapid changes in the values of our target assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a reit or our exemption from the 1940 act. if the market value or income potential of our agency securities declines as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates, general market conditions, government actions or other factors, we may need to increase certain types of our assets and income or liquidate our non-qualifying assets to maintain our reit qualifications or our exemption from the 1940 act. if the decline in real estate asset values or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. we may have to make decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the reit and 1940 act considerations. our qualification as a reit subjects us to a broad array of financial and operating parameters that may influence our business and investment decisions and limit our flexibility in reacting to market developments. in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit, we must insure: · that at least 75% of our gross income each year is derived from certain real estate related sources; · that at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified reit real estate assets at the end of each calendar quarter; · that the remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer, or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer; and · that no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of securities of any one issuer. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences. if we fail to qualify as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax as a regular corporation and may face substantial tax liability. 22 qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements (some on an annual or quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist. we believe we currently satisfy all the requirements of a reit. however, the determination that we satisfy all reit requirements requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control. we have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the internal revenue service, or irs, that we qualify as a reit. accordingly, we are not certain we will be able to qualify and remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes. even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status. furthermore, congress or the irs might change tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings, in each case potentially having retroactive effect, which could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit.  if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year, then: · we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which, among other things, means that we would be unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, · any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders, and could force us to liquidate assets at inopportune times, causing lower income or higher losses than would result if these assets were not liquidated, and · unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification, and thus, our cash available for distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we do not qualify as a reit. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to mitigate interest rate risk effectively or may require us to execute our risk mitigation and derivative activities through a taxable reit subsidiary (trs). the existing reit provisions of the code may substantially limit our ability to hedge agency securities and related borrowings, by requiring us to limit our income in each year from hedging transactions, other than qualified reit hedges, together with any other income not generated from qualified reit real estate assets, to less than 25% of our gross income. in addition, we must generally limit our aggregate income from hedging and services from all sources, other than from qualified reit hedges, to less than 5% of our annual gross income. as a result, we may in the future need to conduct certain hedging and derivative activity through a trs, the income from which will be fully subject to federal, state and local corporate income tax, and we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques. this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur. if we fail to satisfy the 25% or 5% limitations, unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we meet certain other technical requirements, we could lose our reit status for federal income tax purposes. even if our failure was due to reasonable cause, we may have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of income in excess of certain thresholds, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we must distribute at least 90% of our annual reit taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders. from time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes from, among other things, the non-taxable unrealized changes in the value of our interest rate contracts, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we may be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. thus, we could be required to borrow funds, sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts available to invest in agency securities. plans should consider erisa risks of investing in our common stock. investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for a pension, profit-sharing, employee benefit, or retirement plan, considering the plans particular circumstances, under the fiduciary standards of the employee retirement income security act, (erisa), or other applicable similar laws including standards with respect to prudence, diversification and delegation of control and the prohibited transaction provisions of erisa, the code and any applicable similar laws. erisa and section 4975 of the code prohibit certain transactions that involve (i) certain pension, profit-sharing, employee benefit, or retirement plans or individual retirement accounts and (ii) any person who is a party in interest or disqualified person 23 with respect to such plan. consequently, the fiduciary of a plan contemplating an investment in our common stock should consider whether its company, any other person associated with the issuance of its common stock or any affiliate of the foregoing is or may become a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the plan and, if so, whether an exemption from such prohibited transaction rules is applicable. erisa may limit our ability to attract capital from benefit plan investors. it is unlikely that we will qualify as an operating company for purposes of erisa. consequently, in order to avoid our assets being deemed to include so-called plan assets under erisa, we will initially limit equity ownership in us by benefit plan investors to less than 25% of the value of each class or series of capital stock issued by us and to prohibit transfers of our common stock to benefit plan investors. our charter prohibits benefit plan investors from holding any interest in any shares of our capital stock that are not publicly traded. these restrictions on investments in us by benefit plan investors (and certain similar investors) may adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to transfer their shares of our common stock and our ability to attract private equity capital in the future. risks related to our securities the performance or our common stock correlates to the performance of our reit investments, which may be aggressive, compared to other types of investments. the investments we make in accordance with our investment objectives may result in a greater amount of risk as compared to alternative investment options, including relatively higher risk of volatility or loss of principal. our investments may be aggressive and therefore an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.    future issuances and/or sales of shares of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock or have adverse consequences for our stockholders. our charter provides that we may issue up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock. as of december 31, 2010, 16,441,554 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and warrants to purchase up to 32,500,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances or sales of our common stock on the market price of our common stock.  sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. also, we may issue additional shares in subsequent public offerings or private placements to acquire new assets or for other purposes. we are not required to offer any such shares to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. therefore, it may not be possible for existing stockholders to participate in such future share issuances, which may dilute the existing stockholders' interests. we have not established a minimum distribution payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay distributions in the future. we intend to continue to make regular cash distributions to our stockholders in an amount such that we distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments. we have not established a minimum distribution payment level and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described herein. all distributions will be made, subject to maryland law, at the discretion of our board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, any debt covenants, maintenance of our reit qualification and other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time. we cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions. our warrants may be exercised in the future, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market. outstanding redeemable warrants to purchase an aggregate of 32,500,000 shares of our common stock are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $11.00 per share. these warrants likely will be exercised if the market price of the shares of our common stock equals or exceeds the warrant exercise price. therefore, as long as warrants remain outstanding, there will be a drag on any increase in the price of our common stock in excess of the warrant exercise price. to the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. further, if these warrants are exercised at any time in the future at a price lower than the book value per share of our common stock, existing 24 stockholders could suffer substantial dilution of their investment, such dilution could increase in the event the warrant exercise price is lowered. our stock price could fluctuate and could cause you to lose a significant part of your investment. the market price of our securities may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following: · changes in financial estimates by analysts; · fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us; · general economic conditions; · changes in market valuations of similar companies; · regulatory developments in the united states; and · additions or departures of key personnel at arrm. resulting fluctuations in our stock price could cause you to lose a significant part of your investment. item 1b. unresolved
