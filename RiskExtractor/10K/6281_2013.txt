item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. there is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. uncertainty regarding the future stability of the euro zone could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. during the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. if economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.       our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including: • the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products; • changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products; • our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration; • the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors; • competitive pricing pressures; • fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity; • the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components; • any significant decline in our backlog; • the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory; • our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers; • changes in geographic, product or customer mix; • our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels; • potential significant litigation-related costs; • the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials; • the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental and social responsibility regulations; • changes in our effective tax rates in the united states, ireland or worldwide; and • the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control. in addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. as a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not 11 experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis. in addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline. changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations. a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162(m) of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods. long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. we typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. in certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. in other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands. as a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. further, orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, improve our products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets. our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products. product development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. in addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. in addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside the united states. many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve. competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or 12 lower cost. increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. we rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. we rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. this reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. we currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, or tsmc. in addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. in certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers. the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. in addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected. our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products. semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. we invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. our customers have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. in certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. if any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 13 we are involved in frequent litigation, including regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. we could be subject to indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. we primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. as such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our u.s. patents and applications. even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation. we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties. our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches. if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. in addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. 14 if we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected. our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. the competition for these employees is intense. the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. in addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. to remain competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products. an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. both in the u.s. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. in order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders. acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including: • difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses; • diversion of management attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets; • strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations; • the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant; • potential loss of key employees; • exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and • increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation. if we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. we rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products. we, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. for example, in fiscal 2011, our revenue in japan declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country. in addition, flooding in thailand and the philippines in 2012 had disruptive effects on local semiconductor-related businesses. any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states, including in ireland and the philippines. approximately 69% of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets. although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies. potential interest rate increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. at november 2, 2013, our principal source 15 of liquidity was $4,682.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,318.9 million was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the united states. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility, through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic, political and legal risks inherent in international operations, including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies. other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections. we also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans. there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes. we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china. our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. in addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or u.s.-china relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors. a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected. we are subject to increasingly strict environmental, health and safety (ehs) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results. our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made. in addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages, penalties, and civil and criminal fines, and might damage our reputation, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our operating results. compliance with new “conflict minerals” rules recently promulgated by the securities and exchange commission will result in increased costs related to investigations to determine the sources of raw materials used in our products, and to any resulting changes to products, processes or sources of supply. the implementation of these rules could also adversely affect the 16 sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. in addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the u.s. congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. the epa is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. additionally, any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines, suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and damage to our reputation. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes. in april 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due april 15, 2016 (the 2016 notes). in june 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due june 1, 2023 (the 2023 notes and together with the 2016 notes, the notes). our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things: • seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; • refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes; • borrow under our existing revolving credit facility; • divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations; • sell selected assets; or • reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures. such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms. restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities. our current revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior unsecured notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. in addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. our stock price may be volatile. the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by the following factors: • crises in global credit, debt and financial markets; • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; • changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance; 17 • changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation or capital commitments; • departures of key personnel; • alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and • negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors. the stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results. 18 item 1b. unresolved
