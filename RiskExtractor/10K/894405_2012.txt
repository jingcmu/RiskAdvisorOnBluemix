item 1a.   risk factors   each of the following risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. our principal operations are conducted through abf within our primary operating segment, freight transportation. for 2011, abf represented approximately 90% of the companys consolidated revenues. the following risk factors primarily address the risks identified for abf; however, our other reportable operating segments (truck brokerage and management, emergency and preventative maintenance, and special services logistics) are generally or specifically covered by these risk factors.   the transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.   general and industry-specific factors that could have a negative impact on our performance in the future include, but are not limited to, general economic factors; a workforce stoppage by our employees covered under our collective bargaining agreement; difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified employees, drivers and/or dockworkers; an increasingly competitive industry and freight rate environment; loss of key employees; volatile fuel prices as well as the rate of changes in associated fuel surcharges and the effect of fuel surcharge changes on securing increases in base freight rates and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or to obtain sufficient fuel supplies; loss of third-party rail service providers; shortage of third-party service providers or our inability to obtain reliable services from third-parties at reasonable prices; loss of market share to rail or other transportation sectors; increases in the required contributions under our collective bargaining agreements with the ibt for wage contributions and/or benefits contributions to multiemployer plans; increasing capital requirements; increasing costs of maintenance and tires for revenue equipment; excess or insufficient capacity resulting from timing of capital investments; increases in new equipment costs and decreases in the amount we are able to obtain for sales of our used equipment; decreases in the availability of new equipment; increases in the frequency and/or the severity of workers compensation and/or third-party casualty claims; increases in workers compensation and/or third-party casualty insurance premiums; violation of federal regulations and increasing costs for compliance with regulations; violations of environmental laws or regulations; climate change legislation; emissions-control regulations; costs or liabilities associated with legal proceedings; default on covenants of financing arrangements; unsuccessful implementation or delayed increases in business volumes of our service and growth initiatives and emerging business lines; damage to our brand or corporate reputation; unsuccessful business acquisitions; a failure of our information systems; cyber incidents; antiterrorism measures; weather or seasonal fluctuations, including any influence of climate change; significant declines in demand for our services arising from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes; operational or market disruptions, including infrastructure damage; the loss of a key location such as a distribution center; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or changes in accounting rules and requirements. the foregoing risks are largely out of our control and any one of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.   we are subject to general economic factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could significantly reduce our operating results, liquidity and financial position.   our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers business cycles and changes in their business practices. our business is directly affected by levels of industrial production, manufacturing, housing and consumer spending. recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation services. the pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. customers may select transportation services based on pricing alone, which may result in a loss of business for us in some cases. economic conditions could adversely affect our customers business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services. customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. in addition, customers could reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.   we depend on suppliers for equipment, parts and services that are critical to our operations. a disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or related financial constraints on our suppliers business levels could adversely impact our business and results of operations.   11 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   we are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. we have historically been subject to market risk due to variable interest rates, on all or a part of our borrowings under bank credit lines, and continue to be subject to such risk on our accounts receivable securitization facility. changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs in the event we need to borrow against our accounts receivable securitization facility, enter into additional capital lease or note payable arrangements or obtain additional sources of financing. furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our accounts receivable securitization facility, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions or disruption to the capital and credit markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.   our qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in equity and debt securities. declines in the value of plan assets resulting from the instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. substantial future investment losses on plan assets would also increase pension expense in the years following the losses. investment returns that differ from expected returns are amortized to expense over the remaining active service period of plan participants. in addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our pension obligations for financial statement purposes would change the projected pension obligation and impact pension expense, and a change in the rate used to calculate our funding requirements under the pension protection act (the ppa) would impact contributions required to fund our plan. an increase in pension expense may adversely impact our results of operations. significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. an increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. we could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may reduce our net income.   it is not possible to predict the effects of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the united states or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.   we depend on our employees to support our operating business and future growth opportunities. if our relationship with our employees deteriorates, we could be faced with labor disruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reduce our operating results and place us at a disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.   as of december 2011, approximately 75% of abfs employees are covered under a five-year collective bargaining agreement with the ibt that expires on march 31, 2013. the terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may result in a work stoppage which would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations and financial position.   we operate in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion ltl carriers. nonunion companies typically have similar wage costs but significantly lower fringe benefit costs compared to union companies. however, certain nonunion carriers reduced their wage rates for freight-handling and driving personnel in recent years, and wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have also allowed for a lower cost structure than that of abf. we have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.   we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry.   numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. these competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:   12   table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   ·                  we compete with many other ltl carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion ltl carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads, some of which have greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages.   ·                  our nonunion competitors generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers. wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than ours and may impact our competitiveness in the ltl industry. our competitors could reduce their freight rates to gain market share, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy. the resulting increased pricing competition could limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins or grow tonnage levels.   ·                  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain or grow our business.   ·                  competition in the ltl industry from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices.   ·                  our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our market share.   ·                  the trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger ltl carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. we could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining ltl carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size. industry consolidations could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our success.   we benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. the unexpected loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.   we depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. fuel shortages, increases in fuel costs and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   the transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. we have not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage develops. a disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, actions by producers or other factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations.   fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. we charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index. the fuel surcharge rate in effect is available on the abf web site at abf.com. (the information contained on the abf web site is not a part of this annual report on form 10-k nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.) although revenues from fuel surcharges generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. the total impact of higher energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. we cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. during periods of changing diesel fuel prices, the fuel surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary by different degrees. depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, operating results could be impacted. whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating income may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. throughout 2011, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers, although certain nonstandard arrangements with some of abfs customers have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. during periods of increasing fuel costs, the negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue is more evident as fuel prices remain above maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. while the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by   13 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   customers is governed by market forces based on value provided to the customer. when fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase.   we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. significant changes in diesel fuel prices and the associated fuel surcharge may increase volatility in our fuel surcharge revenue and fuel-related costs. volatile fuel prices will continue to impact the base rate increases we are able to secure and could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results. significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from economic or regulatory changes, supply and demand imbalances, actions by producers or other factors that are out of our control, which are not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.   we depend on services provided by third parties and increased costs or disruption of these services could adversely affect our operations.   in 2011, rail utilization accounted for 14.3% of our total miles in the freight transportation segment. a reduction in the availability of rail services could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. if a disruption in transportation services from our rail service providers occurred, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. if these situations occurred, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.   the inability to obtain the services of reliable third-parties at competitive prices or the shortage of quality third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our emerging non-asset-based businesses. third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. these providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. increased industry demand for these services may also reduce available capacity and increase pricing. if we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues and profitability of our non-asset-based businesses.   our business could be adversely impacted by increased competition from freight transportation service providers outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry.   in addition to ltl and truckload motor carriers, we compete against other freight transportation service providers, including railroads. certain challenges in the motor carrier freight transportation industry, such as the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; potential changes to driver hours of service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in more competitive service offerings of rail providers. recent growth in the rail transportation sector has resulted from general economic improvement and a conversion of truckload to intermodal shipping. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if railroads or other freight transportation sectors gain a significant share of the market for our services.   we could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.   under the provisions of the taft-hartley act, retirement and health care benefits for our contractual employees are provided by a number of multiemployer plans. due to the inherent nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. we contribute to multiemployer pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with our collective bargaining agreement with the ibt. other unrelated employers contribute to these multiemployer plans pursuant to their respective collective bargaining agreements. assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. if a participating employer to a multiemployer plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. in the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or if we withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, under current law, we would have material liabilities, the amounts of which could be in excess of our current ability to adequately finance, for our   14 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. we have not received notification of any plan termination, and we do not currently intend to withdraw from these plans.   we currently contribute to 25 multiemployer pension plans, which vary in size and in funded status. the trust funds for these plans are administered by trustees, an equal number of whom generally are appointed by the ibt and certain management carrier organizations or other appointing authorities for employer trustees, as set forth in the funds trust agreements. we contribute to these plans monthly based generally on the time worked by our contractual employees, as specified in the collective bargaining agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. we recognize as expense the contractually required contribution for the period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.   in 2006, the ppa became law and together with related regulations established new minimum funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans. the ppa mandates that multiemployer pension plans that are below certain funded levels or that have projected funded deficiencies adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program to improve the funded levels over a defined period of time. the ppa also accelerates the timing of annual funding notices and requires additional disclosures from multiemployer pension plans if such plans fall below the required funded levels. based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended december 31, 2010, approximately 62% of our contributions to multiemployer pension plans, including the central states, southeast and southwest areas pension fund (the central states pension fund) discussed below, are made to plans that are in critical status (or in the red zone) and approximately 12% of our contributions are made to plans that are in endangered status (or in the yellow zone) as defined by the ppa.   approximately one half of our multiemployer pension contributions are made to the central states pension fund. the central states pension fund adopted a rehabilitation plan as a result of its actuarial certification for the plan year beginning january 1, 2008 which placed the central states pension fund in critical status in accordance with the ppa. our current collective bargaining agreement complies with the rehabilitation plan which was adopted by the central states pension fund prior to the april 1, 2008 effective date of the collective bargaining agreement. the actuarial certification of plan status as of january 1, 2010 certified that the central states pension fund remained in critical status with a funded percentage of 63.4%. in accordance with ppa requirements, the central states pension fund adopted an updated rehabilitation plan effective december 31, 2010, which implements additional measures to improve the plans funded level, including establishing a minimum retirement age and actuarially adjusting certain pre-age 65 benefits for participants who retire after july 1, 2011. the updated rehabilitation plan also effectively caps the required pension contribution rates at the current levels for the rate class applicable to the national master freight agreement (the nmfa); however, any changes to scheduled contribution rate increases under the current labor agreement, which ends on march 31, 2013, would be subject to approval by the bargaining parties. despite the changes made in its rehabilitation plan, we can make no assurances of the extent to which the updated rehabilitation plan will improve the funded status of the central states pension fund.   in 2005, the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) granted an extension of the period of time over which the central states pension fund amortizes unfunded liabilities by ten years subject to the condition that a targeted funding ratio will be maintained by the fund. due, in part, to the decline in asset values associated with the investment losses in the financial markets during 2008, the funded level of the central states pension fund dropped below the targeted funding ratio set forth as a condition of the ten-year amortization extension beginning with the january 1, 2009 actuarial valuation. however, the amortization extension granted by the irs in 2005 expressly indicated that modifications of conditions would be considered in the event of unforeseen market fluctuations which cause the plan to fail the funded ratio condition for a certain plan year. based on information currently available to us, the central states pension fund has not received notice of revocation of the ten-year amortization extension granted by the irs. in the unlikely event that the irs revokes the extension, revocation would apply retroactively to the 2004 plan year, which would result in a material liability for our share of the resulting funded deficiency, the extent of which is currently unknown to us.   other multiemployer pension plans in which we participate have adopted or will have to adopt either a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program, depending on their current funded status as required by the ppa. we believe that the contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreement will comply with any rehabilitation plan that has been or may be adopted by the majority of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. if the contribution rates in the collective bargaining agreement fail to meet the requirements established by the rehabilitation or funding improvement plan required by the ppa for underfunded plans, the ppa would impose additional contribution requirements in the form of a surcharge of an additional 5% to 10%. however, under our current collective bargaining agreement, any surcharges that may be required by the ppa are covered by the contractual contribution rate and should not increase our overall contribution obligation.   15 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   the underfunded status of many plans in which we participate developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved. we believe that the trustees of these funds will take appropriate measures to fulfill their fiduciary duty to preserve the integrity of the plans, or in certain cases, to extend the solvency of the funds by utilizing a combination of several possible initiatives as they have done in the past, although we cannot make any assurances in this regard. the trustees of the central states pension fund concluded for the rehabilitation plan effective december 31, 2010, that imposing additional contribution increases in the current economic environment could risk irreparable harm to the financial condition of many contributing employers, thereby adversely impacting their ability to continue to make contributions to fund the pension plans. any changes to scheduled contribution rate increases through march 31, 2013 under our current collective bargaining agreement would be subject to approval by the bargaining parties. while increasing employer contributions has historically served as a potential remedy to address the underfunded status, other alternatives that may be pursued by the trustees of underfunded plans include establishing a minimum retirement age, reducing or eliminating certain adjustable benefits of the plan or redesigning the plan structure. furthermore, additional legislative changes or action taken by governmental agencies could provide relief.   as previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. in 2009, certain contributing competitors of abf were granted concessions from the ibt which allowed for the suspension of multiemployer pension plan contributions for the eighteen-month period ending december 31, 2010. in 2010, this suspension was extended until june 1, 2011, at which time pension contributions resumed at a significantly lower rate. the reduction of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities and our future contribution requirements.   we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect profitability and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes.   we have significant ongoing capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing or financing arrangements, or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased maintenance costs. forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. if these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on our operations and profitability.   increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.   manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine design requirements mandated by the epa intended to reduce emissions. the latest epa engine design requirements became effective for engines built beginning january 1, 2010. a number of states have mandated, and states may continue to mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. further equipment price increases may result from these federal and state requirements. in addition, greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to impact equipment design and cost. if new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. if we are unable to offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. if the market value of revenue equipment being used in our operations decreases, we could incur impairment losses and our cash flows could be adversely affected.   during prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, we may make strategic fleet reductions. in addition, other trucking companies may reduce fleet levels during recessionary economic cycles, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. if market prices for used revenue equipment decline, we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale and our cash flows could be adversely affected.   16 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   from time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (oems) of tractors and trailers may also reduce their manufacturing output due, for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet oem demand, creating periodic difficulty for oems to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment as economic conditions change. an inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   ongoing claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   our self-insurance retention levels are currently $1.0 million for each workers compensation loss, $1.0 million for each cargo loss and generally $1.0 million for each third-party casualty loss. our self-insurance retention levels for medical benefits are $225,000 per person, per claim year. we maintain insurance for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. if the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. the timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared to prior periods. significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, current and future federal and state regulation and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. in addition, if we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.   we are required by certain states in which we are self-insured to provide letters of credit as collateral for workers compensation and third-party casualty claims liabilities, and we have a program in place with an insurance carrier for the issuance of surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program. we have agreements with certain financial institutions to provide collateralized facilities for the issuance of letters of credit that require cash or short-term investments to be pledged as collateral for the outstanding letters of credit. our surety bonds are also collateralized by restricted short-term investments in certificates of deposit. estimates made by the states and the insurance carrier of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.   we utilize third-party service providers in the operation of our non-asset-based segments. claims may be asserted against us for accidents involving these third parties or for our actions in retaining their services. such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.   increased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.   our recent insurance renewals did not result in significant changes in premiums; however, insurance carriers may increase premiums for many companies, including transportation companies, in the coming years. we could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. if our insurance or claims expenses increases and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected.   we operate in a highly regulated industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation operations, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, safety, contract compliance, insurance requirements, tariff and trade policies, taxation and financial reporting. we could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics or cargo security. compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment productivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.   17 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   the dot rules regulating driving time for commercial truck drivers have had a minimal impact upon our operations. the fmcsa issued revised hours of service rules in december 2011 which have an effective date of february 27, 2012 and a july 1, 2013 compliance date for selected provisions. implementation of the new hours of service rules is not expected to have an impact on our operations; however, future changes in these rules could materially and adversely affect our operating efficiency and increase costs.   our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. the tsa has adopted regulations that require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo background checks by the federal bureau of investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.   csa regulations could potentially result in a loss of business to other carriers, driver shortages, increased costs for qualified drivers and driver and/or business suspension for noncompliance. a resulting decline in the availability of qualified drivers, coupled with additional personnel required to satisfy future revisions to hours of service regulations, could adversely impact our ability to hire drivers to adequately meet current or future business needs. csa scores are available to the general public. shippers may be influenced by these scores in selecting a carrier to haul their freight and, although abf is recognized in the industry for its commitment to safety, carriers with better csa scores may be selected in certain cases. unsatisfactory csa scores could result in a dot intervention or audit, resulting in the assessment of fines, penalties or a downgrade of our safety rating. failures to comply with dot safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. a downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. the loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.   increases in license and registration fees, bonding requirements or taxes, including federal fuel taxes, or the implementation of new forms of operating taxes on the industry could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.   our non-asset-based segments utilize third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. if the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on the operating results and business growth of our non-asset-based segments.   our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. the costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.   we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. we also store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks at some facilities. our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal. if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.   concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. the company is unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. however, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment and diesel fuel, and future legislation, if passed, could result in increases in these and other costs. increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, including diesel engine emissions and/or total vehicle fuel economy, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. we may also be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure or our operating results. furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services.   18 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, which could substantially increase operating expenses.   tractor engines that comply with the epa emission-control design requirements that took effect on january 1, 2007 are generally less fuel-efficient and have increased maintenance costs compared to engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. engine manufacturers have made adjustments to the operating software since the introduction of these engines that have resulted in slightly improved fuel economy; however, the maintenance costs have proven to be markedly higher in comparison to the pre-2007 epa engines. although we anticipate additional improvement in fuel economy as a result of the technologies to be implemented for compliance with the more stringent epa requirements that became effective for engines built beginning january 1, 2010, our costs to acquire and maintain compliant equipment could increase substantially. if we are unable to offset resulting increases in equipment costs with higher freight rates and fuel economy savings, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   we are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects to our business.   the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability and other matters. we are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities which may result from the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings. some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. our business reputation and our relationship with our employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings.   our accounts receivable securitization facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants with which we may be unable to comply. in the event that we borrow against the facility, a default could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and operations.   our accounts receivable securitization facility contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a measure of consolidated tangible net worth and maintaining certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default and dilution. if we default under the terms of the facility, our borrowing capacity may be limited or the facility could be terminated. if we have borrowings against the facility and fail to comply with the covenants of the facility, our debt could be deemed to be immediately due and payable or the facility could be terminated. a default under our accounts receivable securitization facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and, if borrowed against at the time of default, our financial condition.   our initiatives to grow our principal business operations and our emerging lines of business may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.   maintaining and developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure. depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our service initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved.   we also face challenges and risks in executing our growth initiatives in our emerging lines of business. we may not be able to hire and train the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services or we may lose personnel who could take proprietary information about our business to our competitors. furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.   if we are unable to maintain the abf brand and our corporate reputation, our business may suffer.   abf is recognized as an industry leader for its commitment to quality, customer service, safety and technology. our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the abf brand. service, performance and safety issues, whether   19 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   actual or perceived, could adversely impact our customers image of abf and result in the loss of business. adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns and similar matters, which are connected to abf, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships as well as hinder the growth of our emerging lines of business. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for abfs services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.   we may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions.   we evaluate acquisition candidates from time to time and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business. acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. the degree of success of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends in part upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. the possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers and key employees; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications and other systems; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. the diversion of the attention of management from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions.   our information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks, some of which are beyond our control, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.   we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. these systems consist of proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. it is important that the data processed by these systems remains confidential, as it often includes competitive customer information, confidential customer transaction data, employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics. portions of our business utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers. cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operating results. certain of our software applications are utilized by third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as backup systems considered appropriate by management. however, it is not practicable to protect against the possibility of damage created by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity attacks and similar events in every potential circumstance that may arise.   we have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service, malware attacks and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. to date, the systems we have employed have been effective in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. we have made and continue to make significant financial investment in technologies and processes to mitigate these risks. our business interruption insurance, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe, would not specifically extend to losses arising from a cyber incident. a significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and/or cause the company to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.   20 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.   as a result of terrorist attacks on the united states, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. for example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. if security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.   our results of operations can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions.   we can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels. freight shipments, operating costs and earnings can also be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and level of services provided by our non-asset-based segments and, consequently, our operating results.   our financial statements may be impacted by future changes in accounting rules and requirements.   future changes in accounting rules and disclosure requirements could significantly impact our reported financial results and the comparability of financial statements. there are numerous new accounting proposals under development by the standard setting bodies which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial statements, including the recognition of revenue and accounting for leases. furthermore, a conversion from u.s. generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we account for, disclose and present various aspects of our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. potential future changes in accounting rules and regulations could be time-consuming and costly to implement.   the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.   the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes. we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and the fluctuations may be unrelated to our financial performance. our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:   ·                  actual or anticipated variations in our earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity, or those of other companies in our industry; ·                  changes in recommendations or projections of research analysts who follow our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry; ·                  failure to meet the earnings projections of research analysts who follow our stock; ·                  changes in general economic and capital market conditions, including general market price declines or market volatility; ·                  reactions to our regulatory filings and announcements related to our business; ·                  operating and stock performance of other companies in our industry; ·                  actions by government regulators; ·                  litigation involving our company, our general industry or both; ·                  news reports or trends, concerns and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations; and ·                  other factors described in this risk factors section.   our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties.   item 1b.   unresolved
