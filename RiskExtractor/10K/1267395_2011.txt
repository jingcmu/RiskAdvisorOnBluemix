item 1a.   risk factors   we outline below factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking and other statements contained in this report and other documents that we file with the sec. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. however, these are the risks our management believes to be material as of the date of this report. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our future business or results of operations. any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.   introduction   as with any publicly traded company, investing in our equity and debt securities carries risks. our risk management strategy is designed to identify, measure, monitor and manage material risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and we have invested significant resources to develop the appropriate risk management policies and procedures to implement this strategy. nonetheless, the future business environment is intrinsically uncertain and difficult to forecast and our risk management methods may not be successful for this reason or because of other unintended weaknesses in our approach.   we set out below the risks that we have identified using the classification system that we use in our risk management process.   for this purpose, we divide risks into core and non-core risks. core risks comprise those risks which are inherent in the operation of our business including insurance risks in respect of our underwriting operations and market and liquidity risks in respect of our investment activity. we intentionally expose the company to core risks with a view to generating shareholder value, but seek to manage the resulting volatility in our earnings and financial condition to within the limits defined by our risk appetite.   however, these core risks are intrinsically difficult to measure and manage and we may not therefore be successful in this respect.   all other risks are classified as non-core, which include regulatory and operational risks, and we seek as far as is practicable and economic to avoid or minimize our exposure to any such risks that we identify as potentially material.   insurance risks   our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural catastrophic events.   as part of our insurance and reinsurance operations, we assume substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural catastrophic events including severe weather, floods, wildfires, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. the severe weather events to which we are exposed include tropical storms, cyclones, hurricanes, winter storms, tornados, hailstorms and severe rainfall causing flash floods.   the incidence and severity of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes have been and can be substantial. the occurrence of large claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in, and material effects on, our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year and our ability to write new business.   our principal catastrophe exposures by peril and geographic region are set out in the table below, but there are other perils and geographic regions to which we also have exposure.   47 table of contents       tier 1 risks - our largest exposures   tier 2 risks - other significant exposures   tropical storms and hurricanes making landfall in the united states earthquakes in the united states windstorms making landfall in europe and european flood risk tropical cyclones making landfall in japan earthquakes in japan   north american tornados, hailstorms and winter storms earthquakes in south and central america and canada earthquakes in europe, turkey and israel earthquakes in australia and new zealand windstorms making landfall in australia, hong kong and islands in the caribbean   we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future and that climate change may increase the frequency and severity of severe weather events. although we attempt to manage our exposure to these events via a multitude of approaches including geographic diversification, geographical limits, individual policy limits, exclusions or limitations from coverage and limited purchase of reinsurance, these management tools may not react in the way that we expect. in addition, a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones or the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.   we seek to limit the amount of exposure from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any geographic zone. we monitor on a regular basis our exposure to catastrophic events, including earthquake and wind against set limits. currently we seek to limit the probable maximum post-tax loss to 25% of total shareholders equity for a severe catastrophic event that could be expected to occur on average once in 250 years and to 17.5% for a catastrophic event that could be expected to occur on average once in 100 years, although we may change these thresholds at any time. there can be no guarantee that we will not suffer losses in excess of these limits due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the severity and frequency of the events and the error margin resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in external data provided, the modeling techniques and application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders equity exposed to a single catastrophic event.   we rely significantly on models to determine probable maximum losses; those models contain inherent uncertainties and as such our results may differ significantly from expectations.   to assess our loss exposure when we are pricing and managing accumulations, we rely on natural catastrophe models, which model various scenarios using a variety of assumptions. these models are developed by third-party vendors and are built partly on science, partly on historical data and partly on the professional judgment of our employees and other industry specialists. while the models have evolved considerably since the early 1990s they do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred as they have many limitations. these limitations are evidenced by: significant variation in estimates between models and modelers; material increases and decreases in model results over time due to changes in the models and refinement of the underlying data elements and assumptions; and questionable predictive capability over longer time intervals. in addition, the models are not always fully reflective of policy language, demand surges, accumulations of losses under similar policies and loss adjustment expenses, each of which is subject to wide variation by storm.   the validity of modeled outputs also relies heavily upon the quality of the underlying exposure location data. while the quality of data is improving for the industry as a whole, it still needs improvement in all areas but particularly outside of the peak zones in the united states, europe and japan which have been most closely studied and modeled.   modeled outputs may also be misinterpreted. therefore, our results of operations may differ significantly from expectations and the experience represented in our historical financial statements. 48 table of contents the frequency and severity of weather-related catastrophes may increase due to cyclical variations in climate and global climate change.   weather patterns, including the frequency and severity of powerful storms, are believed to be influenced by cyclical phenomena operating over periods of months or years.   for example, many observers believe that the atlantic basin is in the active phase of a multi-decadal cycle in which conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, including warmer than average sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear enhance hurricane activity. this increase in the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes can span multiple decades (approximately 20 to 30 years). there have been larger than average number of atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes in recent years although the impact on insurance losses is determined not by the number of storms that form, but by the number making landfall in populated areas with high insured values.   there is widespread consensus in the scientific community that there is a long term upward trend in global air and sea temperatures and that this is likely to increase the frequency and severity of severe weather events over the coming decades.   given the scientific uncertainty of predicting the effect of climate cycles and global warming on the frequency and severity of catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools, we may not be able to adequately model the associated exposures and potential losses.   we could face unanticipated large losses from events other than natural catastrophes, some of which may involve clash losses under several contracts, and these could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   large losses from single events can occur if we are exposed to such events through more than one insurance or reinsurance contract. such losses are referred to as clash losses. our results can be adversely affected if there is an unexpectedly large number of clash losses in a period or if there is one or more such loss of unexpectedly large value.   we seek to manage our exposure to clash risk by identifying possible scenarios under which we could be exposed and limiting our exposure to these potential scenarios.   some of the more significant scenarios which we have identified in this respect are a terrorism attack in the u.s. or europe, fire or explosion at a refinery or offshore oil and gas installation, a poison gas cloud, the collapse of a major office building in the u.s. or europe, a nuclear core melt, the collision of two ships and the loss of a passenger airplane.   in addition, we may suffer multiple losses from economic, political and financial market events through our writing of lines of business such as financial and political risks, credit and surety reinsurance, professional indemnity and management liability.   for example, we may have substantial exposure to large, unexpected losses resulting from acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. although we may attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages we write, we may not be successful in doing so. in our political and financial risk lines, we write traditional political risks including equity based investment risks, lenders interest, asset protection against political violence and related physical damage. these risks are inherently difficult to underwrite as they require a complex evaluation of the credit and geo-political risks. we also underwrite financial risk which includes all types of trade, debt and project finance. we attempt to manage our risk by diversifying our portfolio and enforcing line size and country aggregation limits and enforcing a global stress loss limit of 20% of capital for these lines of business. however, due to the inherent uncertainties in the model including but not limited to the assumptions and underlying data used and the current economic climate, there could be an increase in frequency and/or severity of political events in multiple countries that could result in losses that could materially exceed our expectations. 49 table of contents we also write war and terrorism cover on a stand-alone basis, although such stand-alone policies are written on a greatly reduced net basis. for example, we generally exclude acts of terrorism and losses stemming from nuclear, biological, chemical and radioactive events; however, some states in the united states do not permit exclusion of fires following terrorist attacks from insurance policies and reinsurance treaties. where we believe we are able to obtain pricing that adequately covers our exposure, we have written a limited number of reinsurance contracts covering solely the peril of terrorism, including losses stemming from nuclear, biological, chemical and radioactive events. these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses. it is difficult to predict the timing of these events with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate. to the extent that losses from these risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   we may suffer from an unexpected accumulation of attritional losses.   in addition to our exposures to natural catastrophe and other large losses as discussed above, our results of operations may also be adversely affected by unexpectedly large accumulations of smaller losses. we seek to manage this risk by using appropriate underwriting processes to guide the pricing and acceptance of risks. these processes, which include pricing models where appropriate, are intended to ensure that premiums received are sufficient to cover the expected levels of attritional loss as well as a contribution to the cost of natural catastrophes and large losses where necessary. however, it is possible that our underwriting approaches or our pricing models may not work as intended in this respect and that actual losses from a class of risks may materially exceed the premiums received thus causing adverse variation in our results of operations.   the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain, particularly under current adverse market conditions.   while global financial conditions remain volatile and uncertain and industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of our liability under insurance or reinsurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. emerging claim and coverage issues could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   in addition, we are unable to predict the extent to which the courts may expand the theories of liability under a casualty insurance contract, such as the range of the occupational hazards causing losses under employers liability insurance. in particular, our exposure to casualty reinsurance and liability insurance lines increase our potential exposure to this risk due to the uncertainties of expanded theories of liability and the long-tail nature of these lines of business.   we may face increased exposure as a result of litigation related to the crisis in the financial markets and recession, volatility in the capital and credit markets and the distress of global financial institutions. these economic and market conditions may increase allegations of misconduct or fraud against institutions that are impacted. shareholders are bringing securities class actions against companies and lawsuits against company executives, directors and officers at investment banks, insurance companies, u.s. sub-prime lenders, real estate investment trusts (reits), and other financial institutions, as well as their respective advisors. actions like this could result in significant professional liability claims on d&o and e&o policies. the full extent of our liability and exposure to financial institutions and professional liability claims in our financial and professional lines as well as our casualty reinsurance line may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 50 table of contents the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions.   historically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. the supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry.   as a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense competition on price and policy terms due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. in addition, any prolonged economic downturn could result in reduced demand for insurance and reinsurance products which could adversely impact the pricing of our products. the supply of insurance and reinsurance may increase, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing or new insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. in 2010, a general climate of poor rate levels and soft market conditions continued for a significant number of our business lines. for 2011, we believe that the conditions will remain at the same levels overall. in respect of current market conditions, see part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  current market conditions, rate trends and developments in early 2011. any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services. in addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly, and we expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality. to the extent these trends emerge, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.   if actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations, our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   many of our contracts in most of our lines of business are generally for a one-year term. in our financial forecasting process, we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior years contracts. if actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write on a renewal basis because of pricing conditions, our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a larger number of reinsurance contacts are subject to renewal.   we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents, general agents and other producers exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us.   from time to time, we authorize managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us. we must rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us. although we monitor our underwriting on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. to the extent that our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.   the aggregated risks associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us.   in our reinsurance treaty business, we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under most reinsurance treaties. this is common among reinsurers. therefore, we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. we are subject to the risk 51 table of contents that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded to us may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume and the losses we may incur.   the failure of any risk management and loss limitation methods including risk transfer tools we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.   we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, such that we must pay losses that exceed a specified retention. in addition, we limit program size for each client and from time to time purchase reinsurance for our own account. reinsurance purchased may not always act in the way intended in the event of a claim due to ambiguities in the wordings leading to potential disputes. in the case of proportional property reinsurance treaties, we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event, though we may not be able to obtain such limits based on market conditions at such time. we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zones limits. we also apply a similar approach to our political risk exposures.   various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective or that disputes relating to coverage will be resolved in our favor. as a result of the risks we insure and reinsure, unforeseen events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   the reinsurance that we purchase may not be available on favorable terms or we may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years.   from time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs. accordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amount of reinsurance or retrocession protection on terms that are acceptable to us from entities with a satisfactory credit rating. we also may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years due to pricing, terms and conditions or strategic emphasis. we have sought previously alternative ways of reducing our risk such as catastrophe bonds, and we may seek other ways such as contingent capital, sidecars or other capital market solutions, which solutions may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional retrocession. our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection for our own account could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results could be significantly adversely affected.   our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. to the extent actual claims exceed our expectations, we will be required immediately to recognize the less favorable experience. this could cause a material increase in our provisions for liabilities and a reduction in our profitability, including operating losses and reduction of capital. if natural catastrophic events or other large losses occur, we may fail to adequately estimate our reserve requirements and our actual losses and loss expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from our reserve estimates. 52 table of contents there are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them. in property reinsurance, there is still the potential for adverse development from litigation associated with hurricane katrina. in casualty reinsurance, there are additional uncertainties associated with claims emanating from the global financial crisis. there is also a potential for new areas of claims to emerge as underlying this segment are many long-tail lines of business. in the insurance segment, we wrote a book of financial institutions risks which have a number of notifications relating to the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and there is also a specific area of uncertainty relating to a book of new york contractor business.   we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. under u.s. gaap, we are not permitted to establish reserves for losses and loss expenses, which include case reserves and ibnr reserves, until an event which gives rise to a claim occurs. as a result, only reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be set aside on our financial statements, with no allowance for the provision of loss reserves to account for possible other future losses. see item 1 above, business  reserves and part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further description of our reserving process and methodology.   profitability may be adversely impacted by inflated costs of settling claims.   our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. we write liability/casualty business in the united states, the united kingdom and australia and certain other territories, where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation. to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. see also part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.   market and liquidity risks   we may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and bond yields.   our financial condition and operating results are affected by the performance of our investment portfolio. our investment portfolio contains fixed income securities which are valued in the balance sheet at market value. the market value of fixed income securities generally moves in the contrary direction to the market yields of bonds. thus their value declines when bond yields rise. bond yields may rise or fall in response to market expectations of future interest rates and as a result of changes in the market valuation of the credit worthiness of the relevant issuers. bond yields were volatile during 2010, which impacted our financial results. changes in bond yields also affect the rate at which funds are reinvested and this may have an adverse effect on investment income and consequently on the results of operations.   interest rates and bond yields are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. our interest rate strategy includes maintaining a portfolio, diversified by obligor and emphasizing higher-rated securities, with a short duration of 3.3 years to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value. in addition we are currently using interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk where we pay fixed and receive floating coupons. despite our mitigation efforts, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value and results of operations. 53 table of contents deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to investment losses, which could affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.   our funds are invested by several professional investment management firms under the direction of our investment committee in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us. see business  investments under item 1, above. although our investment policies stress diversification of risks, conservation of principal and liquidity through conservative investment guidelines, our investments are subject to general economic conditions, market risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets, including, among other things, widening of credit spreads, bankruptcies, defaults, and significant ratings downgrades of some credits, may put our investments at risk. market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods. separately, the occurrence of large claims may force us to liquidate securities at an inopportune time, which may cause us to realize capital losses. large investment losses could decrease our asset base, thereby affecting our ability to underwrite new business. additionally, such losses could have a material adverse impact on our equity, business and financial strength and debt ratings. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2010, 68.2% or $232.0 million, of our income before tax was derived from our net invested assets.   unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with some of our investments could significantly and negatively affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.   we hold, and may in the future purchase, certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities and our reinvestment of $30.0 million in cartesian iris 2009a l.p./cartesian iris offshore fund l.p., which was formed to provide capital for a new bermudian reinsurer, focusing on insurance-linked securities. these investments represented approximately 0.5% of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2010. during the height of the financial crisis even some of our very high quality assets were more illiquid than normal. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments, our investments in the asset classes described above and, at times, our high quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset. if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in unfavorable market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices. as a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.   our investment portfolio includes below investment-grade or unrated securities that have a higher degree of credit or default risk which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   our investment portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, investment-grade securities. however, as a result of downgrades, a small portion of the portfolio is in below investment-grade or unrated securities. at december 31, 2010, below investment-grade or unrated securities comprised approximately 0.2% of our investment portfolio. these securities also have a higher degree of credit or default risk and are much less liquid than the rest of our portfolio. these securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. while we have put in place investment guidelines to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets, it is possible that, in periods of prolonged economic weakness, we may experience default losses in our portfolio. this may result in a reduction of net income and capital, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. 54 table of contents we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.   our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. the functional currencies of our segments are the u.s. dollar, the british pound, the euro, the swiss franc, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar and the singaporean dollar. during the course of 2010, the u.s. dollar/british pound exchange rate, our most significant exchange rate exposure, fluctuated from a high of £1:$1.6379 to a low of £1:$1.4334. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 19.8%, 15.2% and 14.1%, respectively, of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and the british pound. a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and the british pound. we may, from time to time, experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non-u.s./non-british currencies, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   we have used forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure. however, it is possible that we will not successfully structure those contracts so as to effectively manage these risks, which could adversely affect our operating results.   credit risks   our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk.   in accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us. although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, in a significant majority of business that we write, it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations. likewise, when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and, in most cases, the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums. consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business. however, due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk. to date, we have not experienced any material losses related to such credit risks.   since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.   we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. see item 1 above, business  business distribution for our principal brokers by segment. several of these brokers also have, or may in the future acquire, ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that compete with us, and these brokers may favor their own insurers or reinsurers over other companies. in addition, as brokers merge with, or acquire, each other, there could be further strain on our ability to access business through a reduction in distribution channels. loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.   our purchase of reinsurance subjects us to third-party credit risk.   we purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of certain large and multiple losses upon our financial condition. our reinsurers are dependent on their ratings in order to continue to write business, and some have suffered downgrades in ratings as a result of their exposures in the past. our reinsurers may also be affected by recent adverse developments in the financial markets, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. a reinsurers insolvency, its inability to continue to write business or its reluctance to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on us because we may remain liable to our insureds or cedants. 55 table of contents certain of our policyholders and intermediaries may not pay premiums owed to us due to bankruptcy or other reasons.   bankruptcy, liquidity problems, distressed financial condition or the general effects of economic recession may increase the risk that policyholders or intermediaries, such as insurance brokers, may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us, despite an obligation to do so. the terms of our contracts may not permit us to cancel our insurance even though we have not received payment. if non-payment becomes widespread, whether as a result of bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.   the impairment of financial institutions increases our counterparty risk.   we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. we also hold as investments various fixed interest securities issued by financial institutions, which may be unsecured. many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. in addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it. any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.   our ability to pay dividends or to meet ongoing cash requirements may be constrained by our holding company structure.   we are a holding company and, as such, have no substantial operations of our own. we do not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of our insurance subsidiaries. dividends and other permitted distributions and loans from our insurance subsidiaries are expected to be our sole source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including our debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends, to our preference shareholders and ordinary shareholders, if any. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends and make loans to other group companies. the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business. see business  regulatory matters  bermuda regulation  restrictions on dividends, business  regulatory matters  u.k. and e.u. regulation  restrictions on dividend payments, and business  regulatory matters  u.s. entities and regulation  state dividend limitations in item 1, above.   certain regulatory and other constraints may limit our ability to pay dividends.   we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make other distributions. under the bermuda companies act, we may declare or pay a dividend out of contributed surplus only if we have reasonable grounds to believe that we are, and would after the payment be, able to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts. there are further restrictions to those outlined above and as such if you require dividend income you should carefully consider these risks before investing in us. for more information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and our insurance subsidiaries, see business  regulatory matters in item 1, above and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity in part ii, item 7. 56 table of contents strategic risks   we operate in a highly competitive environment, and substantial new capital inflows into the insurance and reinsurance industry may increase competition.   the insurance and reinsurance markets continue to be highly competitive. we continue to compete with existing international and regional insurers and reinsurers some of which have greater financial, marketing, and management resources than we do. we also compete with new companies entering the market and with alternative products such as insurance/risk-linked securities, catastrophe bonds and derivatives. see business  competition under item 1, above for a list of our competitors. there has also been a move for insureds to retain a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously, and industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than risk transferring insurance.   increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability. we have recently experienced increased competition in some lines of business which has caused a decline in rate increases or a reduction in rates. see part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.   recent events may result in political, regulatory and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business.   governments may take unpredictable action to ensure continued supply of insurance particularly where a large event leads to withdrawal of capacity from the market. as a result of the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets, a number of government initiatives have been launched recently that are designed to stabilize market conditions. the u.s. federal government, federal reserve, u.k. treasury and government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other extraordinary actions to address the global financial crisis. there can be no assurance as to the effect that any such governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on our competitive position, business and financial condition in particular. see regulatory risks below.   our insurance subsidiaries are rated, and our lloyds business benefits from a rating by one or more of a.m. best, s&p and moodys, and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease.   ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review by, and may be placed on credit watch, revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, a.m. best, s&p and/or moodys. a.m. best affirmed aspen bermudas and aspen u.k.s financial strength rating to a (excellent). in addition, aspen specialtys and aaics rating was affirmed as part of the aspen group rating. our business written through syndicate 4711 also benefits from lloyds rating which is currently a (excellent) by a.m. best and a+ (strong) by s&p. if our or lloyds ratings are reduced from their current levels by any of a.m. best, moodys or s&p, our competitive position in the insurance industry might suffer and it might be more difficult for us to market our products and to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements. a downgrade also may require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients, and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their insurance and reinsurance contracts with us. some contracts also provide for the return of premium to the ceding client in the event of a downgrade. it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain such terms. a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings and therefore may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility. 57 table of contents a downgrade of the financial strength rating of aspen u.k., aspen bermuda or aspen specialty by a.m. best below b++ or by s&p below a− would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility with barclays bank plc and other lenders, which might adversely impact our liquidity and financial flexibility.   if we fail to develop the necessary infrastructure as we grow, our future financial results may be adversely affected.   our expansion will continue to place increased demands on our financial, managerial and human resources. in 2010, we increased our business written in latin america, entered the u.s. admitted insurance market, added a u.k. regional platform and established an office in cologne, germany and an insurance branch in zurich, switzerland. in addition, the increased regulatory complexity of our business brought about by operating in multiple jurisdictions increases our regulatory risk profile. to the extent we are unable to attract additional professionals, our financial, managerial and human resources may be strained. the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives, potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible. our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and systems to effectively support such transition or expansion. our inability to achieve such development or to manage effectively such growth may impair our future financial results.   acquisitions or strategic investments that we may make could turn out to be unsuccessful.   as part of our long-term strategy, we may pursue growth through acquisitions and/or strategic investments in businesses or new underwriting or marketing platforms. the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business, new personnel, new underwriting or marketing platforms could result in a substantial diversion of management resources. acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation, higher levels of claims than is reflected in reserves and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs. any future acquisitions may expose us to operational risks including:       integrating financial and operational reporting systems;       establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls;       funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses;       the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected; and       financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification, reinsurance and other obligations to us.   we have limited experience in identifying quality merger candidates, as well as successfully acquiring and integrating their operations.   our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions, strategic investments or new platforms will depend, in part, on our success in addressing these risks. any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.   we may fail to execute our strategy in new lines of business and territories, which would impair our future financial results.   we continue to expand our operations and in 2010, among other things, increased business written in latin america, established a u.k. regional platform and a swiss insurance branch. our expansion into new lines of business such as professional liability insurance, global excess casualty and non-marine transportation liability in 2007, financial and political risk, financial institutions and management and 58 table of contents technology liability insurance in 2008, specie and credit and surety reinsurance business incepting in 2009 and non-u.s. agriculture reinsurance and professional liability, d&o and excess casualty insurance in the u.s. in 2010, presents us with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully. we are continuing to strengthen the operational processes to support these lines of business. in general, our techniques for evaluating and modeling risk in these new lines of business are not as developed as the models for pre-existing lines of business. if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure, or otherwise fail to execute our strategy, our results from these new lines of business will likely suffer, perhaps substantially, and our future financial results may be adversely affected.   we may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.   our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully, to deploy capital into more profitable business lines, to identify acquisition opportunities, to manage investments and preserve capital in volatile markets, and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis. to the extent that our funds are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and/or cover claims losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. our additional needs for capital will depend on our actual claims experience, especially for any catastrophic events. any equity, hybrid or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. in the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and, in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities. if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.   our debt, credit and international swap dealers association (isda) agreements may limit our financial and operational flexibility, which may affect our ability to conduct our business.   we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. additionally, we have entered into credit facilities and isda agreements with various institutions. under these credit facilities, the institutions provide revolving lines of credit to us and our major operating subsidiaries and issue letters of credit to our clients in the ordinary course of business.   the agreements relating to our debt, credit facilities and isda agreements contain various covenants that may limit our ability, among other things, to borrow money, make particular types of investments or other restricted payments, sell assets, merge or consolidate. some of these agreements also require us to maintain specified ratings and financial ratios, including a minimum net worth covenant. if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet required financial ratios, the lenders or counterparties under these agreements could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them.   if we are in default under the terms of these agreements, then we would also be restricted in our ability to declare or pay any dividends, redeem, purchase or acquire any shares or make a liquidation payment.   we may be unable to enter into sufficient reinsurance security arrangements and the cost of these arrangements may materially impact our margins.   as non-u.s. reinsurers, aspen bermuda and aspen u.k. are required to post collateral security with respect to liabilities they assume from ceding insurers domiciled in the united states. the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for u.s. ceding companies to obtain credit in their u.s. statutory financial statements with respect to liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers. under applicable statutory provisions, the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit, reinsurance trusts maintained by third-party trustees or funds-withheld arrangements whereby the trust assets are held by the ceding company. aspen u.k. and aspen bermuda are required to post 59 table of contents letters of credit or establish other security for their u.s. cedants in an amount equal to 100% of reinsurance recoverables under the agreements to which they are a party with the u.s. cedants.   as a result of the dodd-frank act, beginning on july 21, 2011, only a ceding insurers state of domicile can dictate the credit for reinsurance requirements. other states in which a ceding insurer is licensed will no longer be able to require additional collateral from non-admitted reinsurers or otherwise impose their own credit for reinsurance laws on ceding insurers domiciled in other states. we note that as a result, several states have begun efforts to change their credit for reinsurance laws and regulations as florida and new york already have, so that qualifying non-admitted reinsurers meeting certain minimum rating and capital requirements would, upon application to the state insurance departments, be permitted to post less than the 100% collateral currently required in most u.s. states. aspen u.k. and aspen bermuda intend to seek approval to post reduced collateral in relevant states.   we have currently in place letters of credit facilities and trust funds, as further described in part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity, to satisfy these requirements. if these facilities are not sufficient or if we are unable to renew these facilities at their expiration due to credit market constraints or unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially-acceptable terms, the ability of aspen bermuda and aspen u.k. to provide reinsurance to u.s.- based clients may be severely limited. security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and/or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to, or otherwise held by, third parties and, consequently, reduce the liquidity of our assets. although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit, the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer, which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda or u.k. law or under our investment guidelines. these restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets, which could adversely affect our profitability. as at december 31, 2010, we had $729.9 million in trust funds or pledged as collateral for secured letters of credit.   the development of our u.s.-based insurance operations is subject to increased risk from changing market conditions.   excess and surplus lines insurance is a substantial portion of the business written by our u.s.-based insurance operations. excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting. as a result, excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers. our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market. if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market, our financial results could be adversely impacted.   further, the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general. this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market. during times of hard market conditions (when market conditions are more favorable to insurers), as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive, business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market. when soft market conditions are prevalent (when market conditions are less favorable to insurers), standard insurance carriers tend to loosen underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines, exacerbating the effect of rate decreases. if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market, our financial results could be adversely impacted. 60 table of contents regulatory risks   the regulatory system under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business.   our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations in territories where we currently engage in business or obtain them in new territories, or may be able to do so only at significant cost. in addition, we may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies. failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or to engage in certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business. see business  regulatory matters in item 1, above.   aspen u.k.  aspen u.k. has authorization from the fsa to write all classes of general insurance business in the united kingdom. as an fsa authorized insurer, the insurance and reinsurance businesses of aspen u.k. will be subject to supervision by the fsa. changes in the fsas structure or requirements from time to time may have an adverse impact on the business of aspen u.k.   in june 2010, the u.k. government announced its intention to create three new regulatory bodies to replace the fsa. we can give no assurance as to how this change in regulatory structure may impact the regulatory landscape in the u.k. unexpected change to market practices may become necessary or desirable as a result of actions taken by the new regulatory bodies, which may impact our results of operations.   material changes in voting rights and connected party transactions may require regulatory approval or oversight by the fsa.   if any entity were to hold 10% or more of the voting rights or 10% or more of the issued ordinary shares of aspen holdings, transactions between aspen u.k. and such entity may have to be reported to the fsa if the value of those transactions exceeds certain threshold amounts that would render them material connected party transactions. in these circumstances, we can give no assurance that these material connected party transactions will not be subject to regulatory intervention by the fsa.   any transactions between aspen u.k., amal (as managing agent of syndicate 4711), aul (as corporate member of syndicate 4711), aspen specialty, aaic and aspen bermuda that are material connected party transactions would also have to be reported to the fsa. we can give no assurance that the existence or effect of such connected party transactions and the fsas assessment of the overall solvency of aspen holdings and its subsidiaries, even in circumstances where aspen u.k. has on its face sufficient assets of its own to cover its required margin of solvency, would not result in regulatory intervention by the fsa with regard to aspen u.k.   aspen u.k. may be required to hold additional capital in order to meet the fsas solvency requirements.   aspen u.k. is required to provide the fsa with information about aspen holdings notional solvency, which involves calculating the solvency position of aspen holdings in accordance with the fsas rules. in this regard, if aspen bermuda, aspen specialty or syndicate 4711 were to experience financial difficulties, it could affect the solvency position of aspen holdings and in turn trigger regulatory intervention by the fsa with respect to aspen u.k. the fsa requires insurers and reinsurers to calculate their ecr, an indicative measure of the capital resources a firm may need to hold, based on risk-sensitive calculations applied to its business profile which includes capital charges based on assets, claims and premiums. the fsa may give guidance regularly to insurers under individual capital 61 table of contents guidance, which may result in guidance that a company should hold capital in excess of the ecr. these changes may increase the required regulatory capital of aspen u.k., impacting our profitability.   changes at the eu level may also affect aspen u.k. and amal.   in addition, given that the framework for supervision of insurance and reinsurance companies in the united kingdom must comply with e.u. directives (which are implemented by member states through national legislation), changes at the e.u. level may affect the regulatory scheme under which aspen u.k., amal and aul will operate. we can give no assurance as to how e.u. and other relevant laws will be applied within the sectors in which aspen u.k. is currently active. unexpected changes to market practices may be necessary or desirable as a result of any action taken by the e.u. commission, which may impact our results of operations.   the eu directive on solvency ii may affect the way in which aspen u.k. manages its business and may lead to aspen bermuda posting collateral in respect of its eea cedants.   an e.u. directive covering the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers, known as solvency ii, was adopted by the european parliament in april 2009 and is expected to be implemented on december 31, 2012. solvency ii presents a number of risks to aspen u.k. and amal. the fsas existing regime is expected to meet many of the new measures but insurers are expecting to undertake a significant amount of work to ensure that they will meet the new requirements and this may divert finite resources from other business related tasks. in addition, the measures implementing solvency ii are currently subject to a consultation process and are not expected to be finalized until late 2011; consequently, aspens implementation plans are based on its current understanding of the solvency ii requirements, which may change. increases in capital requirements as a result of solvency ii may be required and may impact our results of operations. further, under solvency ii, unless the european commission assesses the regulatory regime in bermuda as equivalent to solvency ii, then aspen bermuda may be required to post collateral in respect of any reinsurance of eea cedants, including aspen u.k., which may have a negative impact on aspen bermudas and aspen holdings results. this is because under solvency ii, the prohibition on eea member states imposing collateral requirements on its cedants wishing to take credit for reinsurance only applies in cases of the reinsurers who are situated in a country whose solvency regime is deemed equivalent to solvency ii. therefore, if bermudas solvency regime is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii, then aspen bermudas eea cedants may be required to seek collateral from aspen bermuda in order for the cedant to take credit for such reinsurance. the european unions committee of european insurance and occupational pensions supervisors (ceiops) has recommended to the european commission that bermuda be among the first countries assessed for equivalence with solvency ii. however, the final decision as to whether bermuda is deemed equivalent to solvency ii can only be made by the european commission, which has stated that it will publish its decisions on equivalence by july 2012. as of january 1, 2011, the european insurance and occupational pensions authority (eiopa) replaces ceiops.   the activities of aspen u.k. may be subject to review by other insurance regulators.   aspen u.k. is authorized to do business in the united kingdom and has permission to conduct business in canada, switzerland, australia, singapore, france, ireland, germany, all other eea states and certain latin american countries. in addition, aspen u.k. is eligible to write surplus lines business in 51 u.s. jurisdictions. we can give no assurance, however, that insurance regulators in the united states, bermuda or elsewhere will not review the activities of aspen u.k. and assess that aspen u.k. is subject to such jurisdictions licensing or other requirements. 62 table of contents the bermudian regulatory system and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business.   aspen bermuda is a registered class 4 bermuda insurance and reinsurance company. among other matters, bermuda statutes, regulations and policies of the bma require aspen bermuda to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, to meet solvency standards, to obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares (in certain circumstances) and to submit to certain periodic examinations of its financial condition. these statutes and regulations may, in effect, restrict aspen bermudas ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies, to make certain investments and to distribute funds. with effect from december 31, 2008, the bma introduced a risk-based capital adequacy model called the bscr for class 4 insurers like aspen bermuda to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization.   the bma has published a number of consultation and discussion papers covering the following proposed regulatory changes which may or may not become adopted in present or revised form in the future:       the introduction, for solvency purposes, of an economic balance sheet to ensure that all assets and liabilities are valued on a consistent economic basis;       enhancements to the disclosure and transparency regime by introducing a number of additional qualitative and quantitative public and regulatory disclosure requirements; and       the introduction of own risk and solvency assessment which will require insurers to demonstrate the link between capital adequacy, risk governance process and strategic decision making.   the insurance laws or regulations of other jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business.   aspen bermuda does not maintain a principal office, and its personnel do not solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other activities that may constitute the transaction of the business of insurance or reinsurance, in any jurisdiction in which it is not licensed or otherwise not authorized to engage in such activities. although aspen bermuda does not believe it is or will be in violation of insurance laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside bermuda, inquiries or challenges to aspen bermudas insurance or reinsurance activities may still be raised in the future. the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the united states and various states within the united states. compliance with any new laws, regulations or settlements impacting offshore insurers or reinsurers, such as aspen bermuda, could have a material adverse effect on our business.   amal and aul.  amal is the managing agency and aul is the sole corporate member for our lloyds platform, syndicate 4711. both entities are incorporated in the u.k. both the fsa and lloyds have regulatory authority over amal and lloyds has regulatory authority over aul. both regulators have substantial powers in relation to the companies they regulate, including the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity or to continue as a member of lloyds.   the failure of aaic to amend all of its licenses to write admitted business in the united states.   aaic has licenses to transact insurance in 50 states and the district of columbia but before it can write the specific admitted business it seeks to transact in the united states, it must amend these licenses in certain states and complete form, rules and rate filings. as at december 31, 2010, 32 u.s. states have granted full licensing authority to aaic. however, if for any unforeseen reasons aaic is unable to amend the remaining licenses as required, aaic will be unable to transact business in all 50 states and the district of columbia as intended. 63 table of contents the council of lloyds and the lloyds franchise board have wide discretionary powers to supervise members of lloyds.   the council of lloyds may, for instance, vary the method by which the capital requirement is determined, or the investment criteria applicable to funds at lloyds. the former restriction might affect the maximum amount of the overall premium income that we are able to underwrite and both might affect our return on investments. the lloyds franchise board also has wide discretionary powers in relation to the business of lloyds managing agents, such as amal, including the requirement for compliance with the franchise performance and underwriting guidelines. the lloyds franchise board imposes certain restrictions on underwriting or on reinsurance arrangements for any lloyds syndicate and changes in these requirements imposed on us may have an adverse impact on our ability to underwrite which in turn will have an adverse effect on our financial performance.   changes in lloyds regulation or the lloyds market could make syndicate 4711 less attractive.   changes in lloyds regulation or other developments in the lloyds market could make operating syndicate 4711 less attractive. for example, lloyds imposes a number of charges on businesses operating in the lloyds market, including, for example, annual subscriptions and central fund levies for members and policy signing charges. despite the principle that each member of lloyds is only responsible for a proportion of risk written on his or her behalf, a central fund acts as a policyholders protection fund to make payments where other members have failed to pay valid claims. the council of lloyds may resolve to make payments from the central fund for the advancement and protection of members, which could lead to additional or special levies being payable by syndicate 4711. the bases and amounts of these charges may be varied by lloyds and could adversely affect our financial and operating results.   syndicate 4711 may also be affected by a number of other changes in lloyds regulation, such as changes to the process for the release of profits and new member compliance requirements. the ability of lloyds syndicates to trade in certain classes of business at current levels may be dependent on the maintenance by lloyds of a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency. at present, the financial security of the lloyds market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies, a.m. best, s&p and fitch ratings. see  our insurance subsidiaries are rated, and our lloyds business benefits from a rating by one or more of a.m. best, s&p and moodys, and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease, above.   the syndicate capital setting process within amal is also under the fsa rules but is delegated to lloyds to deal with the detailed procedures. lloyds could request an increase in capital under the fsa rules in similar circumstances as set out above in the section on aspen u.k. as an e.u.-based insurer, syndicate 4711 is also subject to the provisions of solvency ii as noted above.   u.s. entities  aspen specialty, aspen american insurance company, and affiliated producer entities.  aspen specialty is organized in and has received a license to write certain lines of insurance business in the state of north dakota and, as a result, is subject to north dakota law and regulation under the supervision of the ndci. aaic is organized in texas and has licenses to write property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis in all 50 states and the district of columbia. these states also have regulatory authority over a number of affiliate transactions between the insurance companies and other members of our holding company system. the purpose of the state insurance regulatory statutes is to protect u.s. policyholders, not our shareholders or noteholders. among other matters, state insurance regulations will require aspen entities to maintain minimum levels of capital, surplus and liquidity, require insurers to comply with applicable risk-based capital requirements and will impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions. these statutes and regulations may, in effect, restrict the ability of aspen entities in the u.s. to write new business or distribute assets to aspen holdings. 64 table of contents new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.   along with our peers in the industry, we will continue to monitor such changes in existing laws and regulations and the possibility of a dual regulatory framework in the u.s.   in recent years, the u.s. insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies. in addition, the u.s. congress has enacted legislation providing a greater role for the federal government in the regulation of insurance. moreover, the naic and state insurance regulators regularly examine existing laws and regulations. changes in federal or state laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.   as an example of such federal regulation, in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from, among other things, the world trade center tragedy, tria was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the united states. this law has been extended twice, and is currently scheduled to expire on december 31, 2014. tria established a federal assistance program to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and regulates the terms of insurance relating to terrorism coverage. thus, for their direct insurance business, aspen specialty, aaic and aspen u.k. are required to offer terrorism coverage including both domestic and foreign terrorism, and have adjusted the pricing of tria coverage as appropriate to reflect the broader scope of coverage being provided. similar federally-sponsored mandatory programs may come into play in the near future for funding of catastrophic risk or other risks of loss in the public eye, with unknown impact to aspen.   on july 21, 2010, the dodd-frank act became law in the u.s. in addition to introducing sweeping reform of the u.s. financial services industry, the dodd-frank act introduces certain changes to u.s. insurance regulation in general, and to non-admitted insurance and reinsurance in particular. the dodd-frank act incorporates the nrra which will become effective on july 22, 2011. the nrra would establish national standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurers and also sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance. in particular, the nrra gives regulators in an insureds home state authority over most aspects of surplus lines insurance, including the right to collect and allocate premium tax with respect to policies with multi-state perils, and regulators in a reinsurers state of domicile are given the sole responsibility for regulating the reinsurers financial solvency. the nrra also prohibits a state from denying credit for reinsurance if the domiciliary state of the insurer purchasing reinsurance recognizes credit for reinsurance. at the present time, it appears the changes specific to non-admitted insurance and reinsurance will likely have a positive effect for companies such as aspen specialty and aspen u.k., although there is still significant uncertainty as to how these and other provisions of the dodd-frank act will be implemented in practice.   the dodd-frank act also creates the federal insurance office (fio) within the department of treasury, designed to promote national coordination within the insurance sector and would have the authority, in part, to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the united states financial system. the act also provides the fio, jointly with the secretary of the treasury and u.s. trade representative, with the power to enter into agreements with foreign governments relating to the recognition of prudential measures for the business of insurance or reinsurance. in entering into such agreements, the fio will have the authority to preempt state law if it is determined that a state law is inconsistent with the international agreement and treats a non-u.s. insurer less favorably than a u.s. insurer. these measures could ultimately lead to regulation which could have a material financial impact on us. 65 table of contents changes in u.s. state insurance legislation and insurance department legislation may impact on liabilities assumed by our business.   aspen specialty, aaic, aspen u.k. and various affiliates are subject to periodic changes in u.s. state insurance legislation and insurance department regulation which may materially affect the liabilities assumed by the companies in such states. for example, as a result of natural disasters, emergency orders and related regulations may be periodically issued or enacted by individual states. this may impact the cancellation or non-renewal of property policies issued in those states for an extended period of time, increasing the potential liability to the company on such extended policies. failure to adhere to these regulations could result in the imposition of fines, fees, penalties and loss of approval to write business in such states. certain states with catastrophe exposures (e.g., california earthquakes, florida hurricanes) have opted to establish state-run, state-owned reinsurers that compete with us and our peers. these entities tend to reduce the amount of business available to us.   our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions.   from time to time, we may need to hire additional employees to work in bermuda. under bermuda law, non-bermudians (other than spouses of bermudians) may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. work permits are granted or renewed by the bermuda department of immigration upon showing that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no bermudian (or spouse of a bermudian) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. in april 2001, the bermuda government announced a policy whereby unless a work permit holder is otherwise exempt, he or she will be limited to a maximum term of six years. renewal beyond the general maximum of six years is possible if the employer makes a compelling case to justify it because of genuine and real need to renew the permit. generally, no extensions will be permitted beyond a further three years bringing the maximum to nine years in total. non-bermudian employees who have been granted key status to aspen bermuda by the bermuda department of immigration have been granted an exemption from those term limits.   as of december 31, 2010, we had 54 employees in bermuda. julian cusack, the current group chief risk officer and chairman and ceo of aspen bermuda and james few, president, aspen re and chief underwriting officer of aspen bermuda are non-bermudian who are working under work permits that will expire in march 2013. messrs. cusack and few have been granted key worker status by the bermuda department of immigration and therefore term limits do not apply, however, key worker work permits still require renewal to remain valid. even with an exemption from term limits, renewals of work permits are subject to approval by the bermuda department of immigration. in this case, their work permits would only not be renewed in the event that a bermudian (and/or spouse of a bermudian) is qualified to perform their duties. none of our current non-bermudian employees for whom we have applied for a work permit has been denied. we could lose the services of messrs. cusack or few or another key employee who is non-bermudian if we were unable to obtain or renew their work permits, which could have a material adverse affect on our business.   from time to time, government authorities seek to more closely monitor and regulate the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our business.   the attorneys general for multiple states and other insurance regulatory authorities have previously investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry, and in particular insurance brokerage compensation practices.   to the extent that state regulation of brokers and intermediaries becomes more onerous, costs of regulatory compliance for aspen management, asis, aspen re america and ara-ca will increase. finally, to the extent that any of the brokers with whom we do business suffer financial difficulties as a result of the investigations or proceedings, we could suffer increased credit risk. see  our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk and  since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of 66 table of contents our insurance and reinsurance revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us above.   these investigations of the insurance industry in general, whether involving the company specifically or not, together with any legal or regulatory proceedings, related settlements and industry reform or other changes arising therefrom, may materially adversely affect our business and future financial results or results of operations.   the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that are more difficult than those made in a more mature company because we have more limited historical information through december 31, 2010.   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including reserves), revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, insurance and other reserves, reinsurance recoverables, investment valuations, intangible assets, bad debts, impairments, income taxes, contingencies, derivatives and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience, where possible, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.   estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company, like us, are more difficult to make than those made for a more mature company because we have more limited historical information through december 31, 2010. a significant part of our current loss reserves is in respect of ibnr. this ibnr reserve is based almost entirely on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs. in addition to limited historical information, we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish loss reserves. accordingly, actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements.   other operational risks   the loss of underwriters or underwriting teams could adversely affect us.   our success has depended, and will continue to depend in substantial part, upon our ability to attract and retain our teams of underwriters in various business lines. although we are not aware of any planned departures, the loss of one or more of our senior underwriters could adversely impact our business by, for example, making it more difficult to retain clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing personnel. in addition, the loss of services of underwriters could strain our ability to execute our new business lines, as described elsewhere in this report. in general, the loss of key services of any members of our current underwriting teams may adversely affect our business and results of operations.   we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more principal employees or by an inability to attract and retain senior staff.   our success will depend in substantial part upon our ability to retain our principal employees and to attract additional employees. we rely substantially upon the services of our senior management team. although we have employment agreements with all of the members of our senior management team, if we were to unexpectedly lose the services of members of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected. we do not currently maintain key-man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees. 67 table of contents changes in employment laws, taxation and acceptable remuneration practice may limit our ability to attract senior employees to our current operating platforms.   our insurance and reinsurance operations are, by their nature, international and we compete for senior employees on a global basis. changes in employment legislation, taxation and the approach of regulatory bodies to remuneration practice within our operating jurisdictions may impact our ability to recruit or retain senior employees or the cost to us of doing so. any failure to retain senior employees may adversely affect the strategic growth of our business and the results of operations.   we may be adversely affected by action taken against us by former employers of our staff who allege that their former employees may be in breach of legal obligations to them.   within our industry it is common for employers to seek to restrict an employees ability either to work for a competitor or to engage in business activities with the customers or staff of a former employer after leaving employment. in addition, our employees may owe statutory or fiduciary obligations to former employers. the extent of any such post-termination restrictions and the extent to which any alleged contractual restrictions are enforceable is highly fact specific and dependant upon the local laws in the applicable jurisdiction in any case. action taken by former employers to enforce such restrictions, however, even if ultimately found not to be legally binding, may adversely affect our ability to pursue current business objectives.   we rely on third-party service providers for some of our operations and systems.   we rely on third-party service providers for a variety of services and systems, which include but are not limited to, claims handling activity, support on our underwriting and finance systems, investment management and catastrophe modeling. if our third-party service providers fail to perform as expected, it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.   risks related to our ordinary shares   future sales of ordinary shares may affect their market price and the future exercise of options may result in immediate and substantial dilution.   as of december 31, 2010, there were 70,508,013 ordinary shares outstanding. of these shares, most are freely transferable, except for any shares sold to our affiliates, as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act.   moreover, as of december 31, 2010, an additional 1,126,285 ordinary shares were issuable upon the full exercise on a cash basis of outstanding options by appleby services (bermuda) ltd, formerly appleby (bermuda) trust limited (the names trustee), as successor trustee of the names trust, which holds the options and shares for the benefit of the members of syndicate 2020 who were not corporate members of wellington underwriting agencies limited (wual). the names trustee may exercise its options on a cashless basis, which allows it to realize the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the options and the then prevailing market price without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares in cash. thus, the option holder receives fewer shares upon exercise. this cashless exercise feature may provide an incentive for the names trustee to exercise their options more quickly. in the event that the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares are exercised, you will suffer immediate dilution of your investment.   in addition, we have filed registration statements on form s-8 under the securities act to register ordinary shares issued or reserved for issuance under our share incentive plan, our non-employee director plan, our employee share purchase plan and our sharesave scheme. subject to the exercise of issued and outstanding options, shares registered under the registration statement on form s-8 may be available for sale into the public markets.   we cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our ordinary shares, or the availability of ordinary shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our ordinary shares. sales of substantial 68 table of contents amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.   furthermore, on december 12, 2005, we issued 4,000,000 5.625% perpetual income equity replacement security (the perpetual piers). each perpetual piers will be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into one perpetual preference share and a number of our ordinary shares, if any, based on an initial conversion rate of 1.7077 ordinary shares per $50 liquidation preference of perpetual piers, subject to specified adjustments. in addition, at any time on or after january 1, 2009, under certain circumstances, we may, at our option, cause each perpetual piers to be automatically converted into $50 in cash and ordinary shares, if any. the conversion of some or all of our perpetual piers will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. any sales in the public market of our ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ordinary shares. in addition, the existence of our perpetual piers may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our perpetual piers could depress the price of our ordinary shares.   there are provisions in our charter documents which may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares.   in general, and except as provided below, shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. however, if, and so long as, the ordinary shares of a shareholder are treated as controlled shares (as determined under section 958 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code)) of any u.s. person (as defined below) and such controlled shares constitute 9.5% or more of the votes conferred by our issued shares, the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such u.s. person (a 9.5% u.s. shareholder) shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a voting power of less than 9.5%, under a formula specified in our bye-laws. the formula is applied repeatedly until the voting power of all 9.5% u.s. shareholders has been reduced to less than 9.5%. in addition, our board of directors may limit a shareholders voting rights (including appointment rights, if any, granted to holders of our perpetual piers or to holders of our 7.401% perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (liquidation preference $25 per share) (the perpetual preference shares)) where it deems it appropriate to do so to (i) avoid the existence of any 9.5% u.s. shareholder, and (ii) avoid certain material adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to us or any holder of our shares or its affiliates. controlled shares includes, among other things, all shares of the company that such u.s. person is deemed to own directly, indirectly or constructively (within the meaning of section 958 of the code). as of december 31, 2010, there were 70,508,013 ordinary shares outstanding of which 6,698,261 ordinary shares would constitute 9.5% of the votes conferred by our issued and outstanding shares.   for purposes of this discussion, the term u.s. person means: (i) a citizen or resident of the united states, (ii) a partnership or corporation, or entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the united states, or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to u.s. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if either (x) a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more u.s. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a u.s. person for u.s. federal income tax purposes or (z) any other person or entity that is treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing.   under these provisions, certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share, while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share. see part ii, item 5, market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchaser of equity securities  bye-laws. moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the 9.5% limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. our bye-laws provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by them. 69 table of contents as a result of any reallocation of votes, voting rights of some of our shareholders might increase above 5% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares, thereby possibly resulting in such shareholders becoming a reporting person subject to schedule 13d or 13g filing requirements under the exchange act. in addition, the reallocation of the votes of our shareholders could result in some of the shareholders becoming subject to filing requirements under section 16 of the exchange act in the event that the company no longer qualifies as a foreign private issuer.   we also have the authority under our bye-laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholders voting rights are to be reallocated under the bye-laws. if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us, we may, in our sole discretion, eliminate such shareholders voting rights.   there are provisions in our bye-laws which may restrict the ability to transfer ordinary shares and which may require shareholders to sell their ordinary shares.   our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if it appears to the board of directors, in their sole and reasonable discretion, after taking into account the limitations on voting rights contained in our bye-laws, that any non-de minimis adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders or their affiliates may occur as a result of such transfer.   our bye-laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in material adverse tax consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any shareholder or its affiliates, then we have the option, but not the obligation, to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair market value the minimum number of ordinary shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the material adverse tax consequences.   laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we conduct business could delay or deter a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be desirable and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and have the effect of entrenching management, and your ability to purchase more than 10% of our voting shares will be restricted.   ordinary shares may be offered or sold in bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the investment business act 2003 of bermuda which regulates the sale of securities in bermuda. in addition, the bma must approve all issuances and transfers of shares of a bermuda-exempted company other than in cases where the bma has granted a general permission. the bma in its policy dated june 1, 2005 provides that where any equity securities of a bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of the securities of the company from and/or to a non-resident of bermuda, for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed. notwithstanding the above general permission, we have obtained from the bma their permission for the issue and free transferability of the ordinary shares in the company, as long as the shares are listed on the new york stock exchange (the nyse) (which is an appointed stock exchange) or other appointed stock exchange, to and among persons who are non-residents of bermuda for exchange control purposes and of up to 20% of the ordinary shares to and among persons who are residents in bermuda for exchange control purposes. the bma and the registrar of companies accept no responsibility for the financial soundness of any proposal or for the correctness of any of the statements made or opinions expressed in this report.   under the insurance act, each shareholder or prospective shareholder will be responsible for notifying the bma in writing of his becoming a controller, directly or indirectly, of 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of aspen holdings and ultimately aspen bermuda within 45 days of becoming such a controller. the bma may serve a notice of objection on any controller of aspen bermuda if it appears to the bma that the person is no longer fit and proper to be such a controller. 70 table of contents the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any u.k. insurance company or lloyds managing agent which are authorized under the fsma. any company or individual that (together with its or his associates) directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares of a u.k. authorized insurance company or lloyds managing agent, or their parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or lloyds managing agent or their parent company, would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or lloyds managing agent or their parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either. a purchaser of 10% or more of our ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of aspen u.k. or amal. under fsma, any person proposing to acquire control over a u.k. authorized insurance company must notify the fsa of his intention to do so and obtain the fsas prior approval. the fsa would then have sixty working days to consider that persons application to acquire control. in considering whether to approve such application, the fsa must be satisfied both that the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control. failure to make the relevant prior application would constitute a criminal offense. a person who is already deemed to have control will require prior approval of the fsa if such person increases their level of control beyond certain percentages. these percentages are 20%, 30% and 50%.   additionally, as we are the holding company of amal and aul and since lloyds supervises amal and aul, the prior consent of lloyds is required for any acquisition of control, as defined above, of amal and aul.   under the north dakota insurance and texas holding company statutes, if a holder would acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our outstanding voting securities without the prior approval of the north dakota and texas insurance departments, then our north dakota and texas insurance subsidiaries or the north dakota and texas insurance departments are entitled to injunctive relief, including enjoining any proposed acquisition, or seizing ordinary shares owned by any person who has acquired control without prior approval, and such ordinary shares would not be entitled to be voted.   there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned greater than 10% of our ordinary shares did not, because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares, control the applicable insurance subsidiary.   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. if these restrictions delay, deter or prevent a change of control, such restrictions may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance.   we cannot pay a dividend on our ordinary shares unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers, underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid.   our perpetual piers, our perpetual preference shares that are issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers at the option of the holders thereof and our perpetual preference shares will rank senior to our ordinary shares with respect to the payment of dividends. as a result, unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers, underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum (or, if we so elect with respect to our perpetual piers and underlying perpetual preference shares, ordinary shares) sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside), we cannot declare or pay a dividend on our ordinary shares. under the terms of our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares, these restrictions will continue until full dividends on all outstanding perpetual piers, underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares for four consecutive dividend periods have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum (or, if we so elect with respect to our 71 table of contents perpetual piers and underlying perpetual preference shares, ordinary shares) sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment).   our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers, underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares in the event of a liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the company.   in the event of a liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the company, our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers, our perpetual preference shares issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares. in such an event, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after payments to holders of our perpetual piers, underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares, to ensure payments to holders of ordinary shares.   u.s. persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than u.s. persons who are shareholders of a u.s. corporation.   the companies act, which applies to us, differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to u.s. corporations and their shareholders. set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the companies act which includes, where relevant, information on modifications thereto adopted under our bye-laws, applicable to us, which differ in certain respects from provisions of delaware corporate law (which is representative of the corporate law of the various states comprising the united states). because the following statements are summaries, they do not discuss all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders.   interested directors.  under bermuda law and our bye-laws, a transaction entered into by us, in which a director has an interest, will not be voidable by us, and such director will not be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction, provided the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors, or in writing, to the directors. in addition, our bye-laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which that director has an interest following a declaration of the interest under the companies act, unless the majority of the disinterested directors determine otherwise. under delaware law, the transaction would not be voidable if:       the material facts as to the interested directors relationship or interests were disclosed or were known to the board of directors and the board of directors in good faith authorized the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors;       the material facts were disclosed or were known to the shareholders entitled to vote on such transaction and the transaction was specifically approved in good faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to vote thereon; or       the transaction was fair as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified.   business combinations with large shareholders or affiliates.  as a bermuda company, we may enter into business combinations with our large shareholders or one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, including asset sales and other transactions in which a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders or other wholly-owned subsidiaries, without obtaining prior approval from our shareholders and without special approval from our board of directors. under bermuda law, amalgamations require the approval of the board of directors, and except in the case of amalgamations with and between wholly-owned subsidiaries, shareholder approval. however, when the affairs of a bermuda company are being conducted in a manner which is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to a bermuda court, which may make an order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the companys affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or the company. if we were a delaware company, we would need prior approval from our board of directors or a supermajority of our shareholders to enter 72 table of contents into a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder, unless we opted out of the relevant delaware statute. bermuda law or our bye-laws would require board of directors approval and, in some instances, shareholder approval of such transactions.   shareholders suits.  the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders in many u.s. jurisdictions. class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda. however, the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to commence a derivative action in our name to remedy a wrong done to us where an act is alleged to be beyond our corporate power, is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye-laws. furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it. the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action. our bye-laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in the right of the company, against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such directors or officers duties, except with respect to any fraud or dishonesty of the director or officer or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which the director or officer is not legally entitled. class actions and derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under delaware law for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. in such actions, the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action.   indemnification of directors and officers.  under bermuda law and our bye-laws, we may indemnify our directors, officers, any other person appointed to a committee of the board of directors or resident representative (and their respective heirs, executors or administrators) to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs, charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense, incurred or suffered by such persons by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of their duties; provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter which would render such indemnification void under the companies act. under delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in defense of an action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position if (i) such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.   anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors, which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares.   our bye-laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. in addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. for example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future.   for example, our bye-laws contain the following provisions that could have such an effect:       election of directors is staggered, meaning that members of only one of three classes of directors are elected each year;       directors serve for a term of three years (unless 70 years or older); 73 table of contents       our directors may decline to approve or register any transfer of shares to the extent they determine, in their sole discretion, that any non-de minimis adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to aspen holdings, any of its subsidiaries, shareholders or affiliates would result from such transfer;       if our directors determine that share ownership by any person may result in material adverse tax consequences to aspen holdings, any of its subsidiaries, shareholders or affiliates, we have the option, but not the obligation, to purchase or assign to a third party the right to purchase the minimum number of shares held by such person solely to the extent that it is necessary to eliminate such material risk;       shareholders have limited ability to remove directors; and       if the ordinary shares of any u.s. person constitute 9.5% or more of the votes conferred by the issued shares of aspen holdings, the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such u.s. person shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a voting power of less than 9.5%.   we are a bermuda company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers.   we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda. in addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the united states, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states. as such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of u.s. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the u.s. federal securities laws. further, no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of u.s. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda. a bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability, including the possibility of monetary damages, on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law.   we have been advised by bermuda counsel that there is no treaty in force between the u.s. and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. as a result, whether a u.s. judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the u.s. court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers, as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules. a judgment debt from a u.s. court that is final and for a sum certain based on u.s. federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the u.s. court, and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda (not u.s.) law.   in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues, the bermuda courts will not enforce a u.s. federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy. it is the advice of our bermuda counsel that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law, the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction, power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity, will not be entertained by a bermuda court. certain remedies available under the laws of u.s. jurisdictions, including certain remedies under u.s. federal securities laws, would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court, as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy. further, no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of u.s. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda. a bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law. 74 table of contents risks related to taxation   our non-u.s. companies (other than aul) may be subject to u.s. tax and that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.   if aspen holdings or any of its non-u.s. subsidiaries (other than aul) were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states, it could be subject to u.s. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such u.s. business, in which case its results of operations could be materially adversely affected (although its results of operations should not be materially adversely affected if aspen u.k. is considered to be engaged in a u.s. trade or business solely as a result of the binding authorities granted to aspen re america, ara-ca, asis, aspen management, aspen solutions and wellington underwriting inc. (wu inc.).   aspen holdings, aspen bermuda, and acorn limited are bermuda companies, aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services are u.k. companies and apj jersey is a jersey company. we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies (other than aul) will operate in such a manner that none of these companies should be subject to u.s. tax (other than u.s. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring u.s. risks and u.s. withholding tax on certain u.s. source investment income, and the likely imposition of u.s. corporate income and additional branch profits tax on the profits attributable to the business of aspen u.k. produced pursuant to the binding authorities granted to aspen re america, ara-ca, asis, aspen solutions and aspen management, as well as the binding authorities previously granted to wu inc.) because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states (other than aspen u.k. with respect to the business produced pursuant to the aspen re america, ara-ca, asis, aspen management and prior wu inc. binding authorities agreements). however, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states, we cannot be certain that the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) will not contend successfully that some or all of aspen holdings or its non-u.s. subsidiaries (other than aul) is/are engaged in a trade or business in the united states based on activities in addition to the binding authorities discussed above. aul is a member of lloyds and subject to a closing agreement between lloyds and the irs (the closing agreement). pursuant to the terms of the closing agreement all members of lloyds, including aul, are subject to u.s. federal income taxation. those members that are entitled to the benefits of a u.s. income tax treaty are deemed to be engaged in a u.s. trade or business through a u.s. permanent establishment. those members not entitled to the benefits of such a treaty are merely deemed to be engaged in a u.s. trade or business. the closing agreement provides rules for determining the income considered to be attributable to the permanent establishment or u.s. trade or business. we believe that aul may be entitled to the benefits of the u.s. income tax treaty with the u.k. (the u.k. treaty), although the position is not certain.   our non-u.k. companies may be subject to u.k. tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   none of us, except for aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, is incorporated in the united kingdom. accordingly, none of us, other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, should be treated as being resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes unless our central management and control is exercised in the united kingdom. the concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company, which is wholly a question of fact. each of us, other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, currently intends to manage our affairs so that none of us, other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, is resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes. 75 table of contents a company not resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes can nevertheless be subject to u.k. corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom but the charge to u.k. corporation tax is limited to profits (including revenue profits and capital gains) attributable directly or indirectly to such permanent establishment.   each of us, other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, (which should be treated as resident in the united kingdom by virtue of being incorporated and managed there), currently intends that we will operate in such a manner so that none of us (other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services), carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom. nevertheless, because neither case law nor u.k. statute definitively defines the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment, her majestys revenue and customs might contend successfully that any of us (other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services) are/is trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment.   the united kingdom has no income tax treaty with bermuda. there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the united kingdom nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the united kingdom (other than by deduction or withholding) on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a permanent establishment but each of us intends that we will operate in such a manner that none of us will fall within the charge to income tax in the united kingdom (other than by deduction or withholding) in this respect.   if any of us, other than aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services were treated as being resident in the united kingdom for u.k. corporation tax purposes, or if any of us were to be treated as carrying on a trade in the united kingdom, whether or not through a permanent establishment, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   our u.k. operations may be affected by future changes in u.k. tax law.   aspen u.k. holdings, aspen u.k., aspen u.k. services, amal, aul, aiuk trustees, arml, apj and apj services, should be treated as resident in the united kingdom (by virtue of being incorporated and managed there) and accordingly be subject to u.k. tax in respect of their worldwide income and gains. any change in the basis or rate of u.k. corporation tax could materially adversely affect the operations of the u.k. companies.   the taxation (international and other provisions) act 2010 contains a restriction on the deductibility of interest costs in computing taxable profits of companies for u.k. tax purposes, known as the worldwide debt cap, which applies to accounting periods beginning on or after january 1, 2010. broadly, u.k. tax deductions for the net finance expense of the u.k. companies in a group are restricted by reference to (if less) the amount of the gross consolidated finance expense of the worldwide group.   however, there is an exemption from the worldwide debt cap, if all or substantially all of either the u.k. trading income or the worldwide trading income of the group is derived from the effecting or carrying out of insurance contracts, or investment business arising directly from such insurance activities. on the basis of the current business activities of the aspen group, we consider that this exemption should apply. however, any disallowance of interest costs in computing taxable profits for u.k. tax purposes could adversely affect the tax charge to which the aspen group is subject.   consultation is ongoing with regard to changes to the u.k. controlled foreign company rules. in november 2010, the u.k. government published the details of the new proposed regime and draft legislation, with a view to legislating in the finance bill 2011 (in respect of the proposed interim improvements to the controlled foreign company rules and announced its intention to further legislate in 76 table of contents the finance bill 2012). any changes to the u.k. controlled foreign company rules might affect the u.k.-resident entities of the aspen group.   our u.k. operations may be adversely affected by a transfer pricing adjustment in computing u.k. taxable profits.   any arrangements between u.k.-resident entities of the aspen group and other members of the aspen group are subject to the u.k. transfer pricing regime. consequently, if any agreement (including any reinsurance agreements) between a u.k.-resident entity of the aspen group and any other aspen group entity (whether that entity is resident in or outside the u.k.) is found not to be on arms length terms and as a result a u.k. tax advantage is being obtained, an adjustment will be required to compute u.k. taxable profits as if such an agreement were on arms length terms. any transfer pricing adjustment could adversely impact the tax charge suffered by the relevant u.k.-resident entities of the aspen group.   holders of 10% or more of aspen holdings shares may be subject to u.s. income taxation under the controlled foreign corporation (cfc) rules.   if you are a 10% u.s. shareholder (defined as a u.s. person (as defined below) who owns (directly, indirectly through non-u.s. entities or constructively (as defined below)) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a non-u.s. corporation), that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year, and you own shares in the non-u.s corporation directly or indirectly through non-u.s. entities on the last day of the non-u.s. corporations taxable year on which it is a cfc, you must include in your gross income for u.s. federal income tax purposes your pro rata share of the cfcs subpart f income, even if the subpart f income is not distributed. subpart f income of a non-u.s. insurance corporation typically includes non-u.s. personal holding company income (such as interest, dividends and other types of passive income), as well as insurance and reinsurance income (including underwriting and investment income). a non-u.s. corporation is considered a cfc if 10% u.s. shareholders own (directly, indirectly through non-u.s. entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section 958(b) of the code (i.e., constructively)) more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of that non-u.s. corporation, or the total value of all stock of that non-u.s. corporation. for purposes of taking into account insurance income, a cfc also includes a non-u.s. insurance company earning insurance income in which more than 25% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock (or more than 25% of the total value of the stock) is owned by 10% u.s. shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts (other than certain insurance or reinsurance related to some country risks written by certain insurance companies, not applicable here) exceeds 75% of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks.   for purposes of this discussion, the term u.s. person means: (i) a citizen or resident of the united states, (ii) a partnership or corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the united states, or organized under the laws of any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to u.s. federal income taxation regardless of its source, (iv) a trust if either (x) a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more u.s. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a u.s. person for u.s. federal income tax purposes and (v) any other person or entity that is treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing.   we believe that because of the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power (these provisions are described under bye-laws in part ii, item 5 below) and other factors, no u.s. person who owns shares of aspen holdings directly or indirectly through one or more non-u.s. entities should be treated as owning (directly, indirectly through non-u.s. entities, or constructively) 10% or more of the total voting power of all classes of shares of 77 table of contents aspen holdings or any of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. it is possible, however, that the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions.   u.s. persons who hold our shares may be subject to u.s. income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our related party insurance income (rpii).   if the rpii (determined on a gross basis) of any of our non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed 20% of that companys gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through entities 20% or more of the voting power or value of aspen holdings, then a u.s. person who owns any shares of such non-u.s. insurance subsidiary (directly or indirectly through non-u.s. entities) on the last day of the taxable year on which it is an rpii cfc would be required to include in its income for u.s. federal income tax purposes such persons pro rata share of such companys rpii for the entire taxable year, determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to u.s. persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected. in addition, any rpii that is includible in the income of a u.s. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. the amount of rpii earned by a non-u.s. insurance subsidiary (generally, premium and related investment income from the indirect or direct insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect u.s. holder of shares or any person related to such holder) will depend on a number of factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by the company. we believe that the direct or indirect insureds of each of our non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries (and related persons) did not directly or indirectly own 20% or more of either the voting power or value of our shares in prior years of operation and we do not expect this to be the case in the foreseeable future. additionally, we do not expect gross rpii of each of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to equal or exceed 20% of its gross insurance income in any taxable year for the foreseeable future, but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of rpii may be beyond our control.   u.s. persons who dispose of our shares may be subject to u.s. federal income taxation at the rates applicable to dividends on a portion of such disposition.   section 1248 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, in conjunction with the rpii rules provides that if a u.s. person disposes of shares in a non-u.s. corporation that earns insurance income in which u.s. persons own 25% or more of the shares (even if the amount of gross rpii is less than 20% of the corporations gross insurance income and the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the 20% threshold), any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holders share of the corporations undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares (whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii). in addition, such a holder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned by the holder. these rpii rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because aspen holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business. the rpii provisions, however, have never been interpreted by the courts or the treasury department in final regulations, and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form. it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes, as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs, the courts, or otherwise, might have retroactive effect. the treasury department has authority to impose, among other things, additional reporting requirements with respect to rpii. accordingly, the meaning of the rpii provisions and the application thereof to us is uncertain. 78 table of contents u.s. persons who hold our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company (pfic) for u.s. federal income tax purposes.   if we are considered a pfic for u.s. federal income tax purposes, a u.s. person who owns any of our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected. in addition, if we were considered a pfic, upon the death of any u.s. individual owning shares, such individuals heirs or estate would not be entitled to a step-up in the basis of the shares that might otherwise be available under u.s. federal income tax laws. we believe that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a pfic for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we cannot assure you, however, that we will not be deemed a pfic by the irs. if we were considered a pfic, it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to u.s. federal income taxation. there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company. new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. we cannot predict what impact, if any, such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to u.s. federal income taxation.   u.s. tax-exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.   a u.s. tax-exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of the insurance income of any of our non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries is allocated to the organization, which generally would be the case if any of our non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries is a cfc and the tax-exempt shareholder is a u.s. 10% shareholder or there is rpii, certain exceptions do not apply and the tax-exempt organization owns any of our shares. although we do not believe that any u.s. persons should be allocated such insurance income, we cannot be certain that this will be the case. u.s. tax-exempt investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors.   scope of application of recently enacted legislation is uncertain.   the u.s. congress enacted legislation in 2010 that would require our non-u.s. companies to enter into agreements with the irs that would require our non-u.s. companies, if characterized as foreign financial institutions, to obtain information about our noteholders and shareholders and to disclose information about our u.s. noteholders and shareholders to the irs and would appear to impose a 30% withholding tax on certain payments of u.s. source income to our non-u.s. companies if they do not enter into the agreement, are unable to obtain information about our u.s. noteholders and shareholders or otherwise fails to satisfy the obligations under the agreement. additionally, if our non-u.s. companies are characterized as a foreign financial institution and do enter into such an agreement with the irs, a 30% withholding tax could be imposed on noteholders and shareholders that do not provide the required information. if our non-u.s. companies are characterized as a foreign financial institution and cannot satisfy these obligations, payments of u.s. source income made after december 31, 2012 on obligations not outstanding on march 18, 2012 to our non-u.s. companies or, in the case of a company that enters into the appropriate agreement with the irs, payments by our non-u.s. companies related to such u.s. source income to noteholders or shareholders that do not provide the required information after this date will be subject to such withholding tax under the legislation. as a result, noteholders and shareholders may be required to provide any information that our non-u.s. companies determines necessary to avoid the imposition of such withholding tax in order to allow our non-u.s. companies to satisfy such obligations. further, if our non-u.s. companies are not characterized as foreign financial institutions, they would appear to be subject to such 30% withholding tax on certain payments of u.s. source income unless they either provide information to withholding agents with respect to our substantial u.s. owners or make certain certifications. companion provisions may require individual shareholders to annually report with their u.s. federal income tax returns certain information with respect to our non-u.s. companies (specified foreign financial assets). the u.s. treasury is expected to 79 table of contents issue regulations clarifying the scope of this legislation. for these purposes, a foreign financial institution is generally a non-u.s. entity that (i) accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business, (ii) holds financial assets for the accounts of others as a substantial portion of its business or (iii) is engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, partnership interests, commodities, or any interest in such securities, partnership interests or commodities.   potential fbar reporting and reporting of specified foreign financial assets.   u.s. persons holding our shares (and non-u.s. persons holding our shares that are in and doing business in the united states) should consider their possible obligation to file a irs form td f 90-22.1  foreign bank and financial accounts report  with respect to their shares. additionally, such u.s. and non-u.s. persons should consider their possible obligations to annually report certain information with respect to us with their u.s. federal income tax returns. shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirement which may apply with respect to their ownership of our shares.   changes in u.s. federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our shares.   legislation has been introduced in the u.s. congress intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain u.s. connections. for example, legislation has been introduced in congress to limit the deductibility of reinsurance premiums paid by u.s. companies to non  u.s. affiliates, which, if enacted, could adversely impact our results.   further, the u.s. federal income tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a trade or business within the united states, or is a pfic, or whether u.s. persons would be required to include in their gross income the subpart f income or the rpii of a cfc are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic rules to insurance companies and the regulations regarding rpii are still in proposed form. new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming. we cannot be certain if, when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.   the impact of bermudas letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda.   the organization for economic cooperation and development (the oecd), has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. in the oecds progress report dated april 2, 2009, bermuda was designated as an oecd white list jurisdiction that has substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standards. the standards for the oecd compliance are to have at least 12 signed tax information exchange agreements (tieas) with other oecd members or non-oecd members. as of december 31, 2010, bermuda had 23 signed tieas which exceed the requisite amount, demonstrating the bermuda governments commitment to preserve the standards. we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes.   additional information   aspens website address is www.aspen.bm. we make available on our website our annual reports on form
