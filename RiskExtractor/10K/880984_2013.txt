item 1a. risk factors   we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward-looking information.  however, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections.  the following risks and uncertainties, together with other factors not presently determinable, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections. general factors   we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments.   despite the gain on our sale of coalogix in 2011, we have a history of operating losses, and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years.  in 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had operating losses of $6.5 million, $8.0 million and $20.7 million, respectively.  cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was $6.3 million, $7.8 million and $22.2 million, respectively.   in addition, we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities and expect to continue to support at least a portion of the financing needs of our subsidiaries.  while we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next 12 months, we may need additional funds to finance future investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake.  we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable.  we may have to limit or adjust our investment/acquisition strategy in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals. we believe that our current cash plus the cash generated from operations and borrowing from available lines of credit, if necessary, will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance the operating activities of acorn and the operations of its operating subsidiaries at their current level of operations for the foreseeable future and for the next 12 months in particular. in order to position ourselves to take advantage of potential market expansion or complimentary acquisitions for our existing businesses, we are contemplating whether and on what terms we may offer additional securities for sale in the future. we currently expect that we may conduct such an offering sometime during 2013, the amount and terms of which cannot be determined at this time. the ongoing instability in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. the ongoing global financial crisis may limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. accordingly, if the global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. in october 2011, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which acorn expected to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock. we intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of acorn applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: • our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in our subsidiaries; • use of cash to consummate acquisition transactions; • stock repurchase programs; • changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and • changes to our business model. our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.  17 table of contents we depend on key management for the success of our business.   our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel.  in particular, our success depends on the continued efforts of john a. moore, our ceo, benny sela, ceo of dsit, lindon shiao, ceo of gridsense, deena redding, ceo of omnimetrix and jim andersen, ceo of ussi and other key management level employees.  the loss of the services of any of these key employees could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.  we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of these employees other than for our ceo, john a. moore. although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them, members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods.  we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available.   loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations.   we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel.  the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers.  the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules.  the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers.  although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non-competition agreements, the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured.  our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel.  if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, our business could be disrupted. our vice president of external relations assists in certain legislative and other governmental relations matters - such activities and the activities of other personnel may be deemed to be lobbying efforts. to the extent that our vice president of external relations engages in activities that constitute “lobbying” under federal, state, or local laws, we have to register him and possibly ourselves and one or more of our subsidiaries under such applicable laws.  in addition, some states have so-called procurement lobbying rules that require sales personnel who interact with governmental officials in certain sales activities to register as lobbyists as well. lobbying laws typically require periodic financial and other reports to be timely made and prohibit some types of contributions, gifts and other expenditures by lobbyists and their affiliates. any failure to register or to comply with the applicable regulations could subject us, our employees and officers and directors to civil or criminal penalties.  we intend to comply with such laws. our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect.   a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock or the common stock of our subsidiaries. if the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. in addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.   compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations.   keeping informed of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting standards, including the sarbanes-oxley act, dodd-frank act, as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources.  compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities. new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses. the sec released final rules in august 2012 regarding mandatory disclosure by public companies of sourcing information related to their use of “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. assuming the rules remain effective, we will be required to conduct specified due diligence activities for the 2013 calendar year, and provide our first report in may 2014. recently, a challenge to the rules was filed by the national association of manufacturers and the u.s. chamber of commerce in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia. the outcome of such litigation cannot be determined, but if the rules remain in force in substantially their current form, we will have to determine whether conflict minerals are necessary for the functionality of any of our products, and if so, undertake steps to determine their  18 table of contents origin. we anticipate that fulfilling our compliance obligations with the rules will be both time consuming and potentially costly. although the exact amount cannot be determined at this time, commentators have suggested compliance could costs companies like ours as much as several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. although we anticipate that our costs will be substantially lower, we may also incur additional expenses related to any changes to our products we may decide are advisable based upon our due diligence findings, as well as increased supply costs as alternative supply sources may not be competitively priced.  we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.   part of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies such as omnimetrix in february 2012 or complimentary companies for our subsidiaries. any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition's management into our controls, systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   our strategy is to continue to integrate our newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies.  integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences.  integrating acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:   • failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; • inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies; • dilution of existing stockholders; • potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management; • difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies; • difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies, sales and marketing, and research and development efforts; and • the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures. in order to grow, one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions. any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing.  we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources. we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.   as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements. the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, dodd-frank act and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") and nasdaq, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies.  these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities.  we expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations, we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs.  we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel, but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.   we may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.   from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.   goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   in accordance with applicable accounting principles, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed if certain conditions exist. while we have not recorded an impairment of  19 table of contents goodwill during the years ended december 31, 2012 or 2011, during the year ended december 31, 2010, we recorded a $5.0 million impairment of goodwill associated with our former coreworx subsidiary following our decision to stop funding it and an impairment of $1.2 million associated with our gridsense segment. any additional impairment of the value of goodwill will result in an additional charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods.   while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past, we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form 10-k. our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   as a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.   if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful, others may duplicate our technology.   our operating companies rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.  our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, systems designs and manufacturing processes.  the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage.  we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or, in the case of patents issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes.  further, a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas.  even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours. we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property.  while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so.  these actions could place our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products, systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends. furthermore, it is not practical from a cost/benefit perspective to file for patent or trademark protection in every jurisdiction where we now or in the future may conduct business. in those territories where we do not have the benefit of patent or trademark protections, our competitors may be able to prevent us from selling our products or otherwise limit our ability to advertise under our established product names and we may face risks associated with infringement litigation as discussed below.   we rely, to a significant degree, on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.  these trade secrets either cannot be protected by patent protection or we have determined that seeking a patent is not in our interest.  these  20 table of contents agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.  our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors.   third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful.  we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights. in recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology-related industries and we believe that the industries in which certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity.    third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop, manufacture or provide our current and future products, systems or services infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights.  we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products, systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others or incur additional marketing costs if we are prevented from using existing product names.  the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology, products, systems and services.  in addition, the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty.   litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.  the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks.  claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers.  however, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all.  any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services.  we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services. we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights. it can be difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.         as part of our business operations, we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. insurance products are impacted by market fluctuations and can become expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain. there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance at an affordable price for the required limits. our failure to obtain such insurance could lead to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or cause us to be out of compliance with our contractual obligations. we may in the future be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company. while insurance can mitigate some of this risk, due to our current size and limited operating history, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance with significant coverage limits. our customers may not accept the terms we have been able to procure and seek to terminate our existing contracts or cease to do business with us.   concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments, which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, restricted deposits and accounts receivable.  the company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits were deposited with u.s., israeli and australian banks and other financial institutions and amounted to $27.0 million at december 31, 2012.  the company uses major banks and brokerage firms to invest its excess cash, primarily in money market funds. the counterparty to the company's restricted deposits are two major israeli banks. the company does not believe there is significant risk of non-performance by these counterparties. related credit risk would result from a default by the financial institutions or issuers of investments to the extent of the recorded carrying value of these assets.  approximately 37% of the accounts receivable at december 31, 2012, were due from one customer which pays its receivables over usual credit periods.  credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the company’s customer base. approximately 70% of the balance in unbilled revenue at december 31, 2012 was due from two   21 table of contents customers that when billed, pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods.  credit risk with respect to the balance of unbilled revenue is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base.   results from our past successful sales of subsidiary companies may not be repeated in the past, we have sold certain former subsidiaries (comverge and coalogix) at a profit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repeat these successes with one or more of our current subsidiaries.  we invest in companies before they have a meaningful history of revenues and whether we can operate these entities successfully or realize any profit on our investments in them cannot be determined.      risks related to dsit solutions   failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed-priced contracts could reduce dsit's margins.   when working on a fixed-price basis, dsit undertakes to deliver software or integrated hardware/software solutions to a customer’s specifications or requirements for a particular project.  the profits from these projects are primarily determined by dsit's success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs.  costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors, including underestimating costs, difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract.  if, for any reason, dsit's costs are substantially higher than expected, it may incur losses on fixed-price contracts. hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli high-tech market and may harm dsit's operations.   dsit's operations are conducted in israel.  accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit.  any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi-tech market, which may result in a deterioration of the results dsit's operations.  in addition, an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to dsit's operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to its offices or those of its customers or harm to its personnel. furthermore, the mandatory military commitments of some dsit personnel may temporarily impact our ability to produce our products on a timely basis if such personnel are called into service in connection with hostilities or otherwise.   exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of dsit's operations.   a majority of dsit’s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u.s dollars or are in new israeli shekels (“nis”) linked to the u.s. dollar.  at the same time, most of dsit’s expenses are denominated in nis (primarily labor costs) and are not linked to any foreign currency.  the net effect of a devaluation of the u.s. dollar relative to the nis is that dsit’s costs in dollar terms increases more than its revenues. dsit enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations; however, we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully. in 2012 the nis strengthened in relation to the u.s. dollar by 2.3%. dsit is substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline.   in 2012, approximately 70% of dsit’s revenues were concentrated in two customers. these customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit’s revenues and cash flow for 2013. a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit.   dsit is dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for its operations.   dsit's operations place a great reliance on it meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance its operations.  should dsit encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones, resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its operations.   dsit must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects. these guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits.   some of the projects dsit performs require significant performance and/or bank guarantees. at december 31, 2012, dsit had $2.6 million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding. in addition, dsit had on deposit at two israeli banks  22 table of contents approximately $0.8 million collateralizing some of these guarantees. these deposits are restricted and, accordingly, dsit cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released. at times, this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations.   in addition, dsit may not always be able to supply such guarantees or restricted deposits without financial assistance from acorn.  if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit, acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to it in a timely manner.   if dsit is unable to keep pace with rapid technological change, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may suffer.   some of dsit's solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence.  dsit's competitiveness and future success depends on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis.  a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position.  a failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay dsit's development of new products, which could result in technological obsolescence, decreased revenues, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.  to the extent that dsit fails to keep pace with technological change, its revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.   dsit is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with components for some of its products.   a number of dsit's suppliers provide it with major components for some of its products for the energy & security sonar solutions segment. some of these components are long-lead items. if for some reason, the suppliers cannot provide dsit with the component when it is needed and dsit cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms, dsit may have increased costs and/or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence. in addition, project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. while dsit is constantly attempting to develop secondary suppliers for these components, it can provide no assurance that it will be successful in doing so on acceptable terms. dsit is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.   some of dsit's current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with dsit's existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. dsit is negotiating with ussi a transfer of technology agreement whereby dsit would receive from ussi an exclusive world-wide license to use ussi technology to provide systems, devices, installations and methods for monitoring ground sites, facilities, locations and perimeters and against land-based security threats for government and non-government customers for defense, security or military and safety applications. dsit is currently investing significant amounts of capital in creating the infrastructure to support the transfer of technology and any final agreement with ussi may involve significant payments to ussi for the license to use the ussi technology. we have no assurance that the transfer of technology will be completed within the expected time frame or budget currently anticipated, or that we will be able to obtain any necessary export licenses from the us authorities on acceptable terms or at all. we further have no assurance that following the completion of the transfer of technology, that dsit will successfully be able to integrate it into its portfolio of products and be able to commercialize the applications. dsit is planning to expend significant resources to integrate its active sonar diver detection system with ussi's fiber optic sensors to create an active-passive sonar diver detection system (pauss) as well as working to develop fiber-optic land-based perimeter security systems. work on the pauss project has begun, but continued development will require ussi to obtain certain export licenses from either the u.s. department of commerce or state department and whether such licenses can be obtained on a timely basis or terms cannot be determined. the bird foundation grant is designated to cover 50% of the development costs of the project over a period of two years. payment of the grant is dependent on continued progress being made in accordance with a contractually agreed upon time-line. furthermore, we have no assurance that the development of these systems will be completed within the  23 table of contents expected time frame or budgets. we further have no assurance that if dsit successfully develops these systems, that dsit will successfully be able to commercialize the applications.   risks related to gridsense   gridsense has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability.   gridsense incurred net losses for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  we believe that gridsense will reduce its losses in 2013; however, we can provide no assurance that gridsense will generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows.   gridsense will need additional financing to grow and finance its operations   in 2012, we invested $5.3 million in gridsense and gridsense signed a loan and security agreement with a bank and received a $1.0 million line-of-credit. however, we expect that gridsense will continue to require working capital support in 2013 to finance its operations in 2013 as it works to grow its revenues (through march 1, 2013, we have invested an additional $450,000 (out of a committed 2013 investment of $1.5 million - see liquidity and capital resources) in gridsense. we have no assurance whether and to what extent gridsense will have access to the entire $1.0 million facility given that the availability is subject to a calculated borrowing base as well as certain financial and other covenants. additional support to gridsense may be in the form of an additional or expanded bank line, new investment by others, additional investment by acorn, or a combination of the above. we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms.  the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies.   gridsense’s products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of gridsense. the primary market for gridsense’s products and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain. if the markets for gridsense’s products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition, its business will suffer. as a result, gridsense may be unable to: (i) successfully market its current products and services, (ii) develop new products, services and enhancements to current products and services, (iii) complete customer installations on a timely basis or (iv) complete products and services currently under development. if gridsense’s products and services are not accepted by its customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, gridsense’s business and operating results will be materially affected. in addition, we can provide no assurance that gridsense will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives. gridsense’s products are subject to regulatory approvals.   numerous regulations govern the manufacture and sale of gridsense’s products in the united states and other countries where gridsense intends to market its products. such regulation bears upon the approval of manufacturing techniques, testing procedures and approval for the manufacturing and sale of gridsense’s products, including advertising and labeling.   any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to market our products. furthermore, product approvals may be withdrawn if problems occur following initial marketing or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained.  the failure, delay or withdrawal of a previously given regulatory approval could materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and financial position. sales to utilities are generally characterized by long sales cycles. gridsense’s sales are largely dependent on the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support.  the purchasing cycle for a utility may involve an evaluation trial or pilot, analysis of data and results, review of competitor’s offerings and smaller scale deployments, before a purchasing decision is made.  for large orders, some utilities are required to solicit competitive bids from other vendors which can contribute significantly more time and result in lost sales opportunities. at best, the sales cycle can take several months and in certain circumstances it can be a multi-year process.  delays in securing purchase orders can materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and financial condition.    24 table of contents gridsense is attempting to broaden its revenue base by expanding into the north american market. gridsense is currently recording a significant portion of its revenue from sales generated in australia (more than 45% in both 2011 and 2012 and more than 60% for the 2010 calendar year).  gridsense believes that growth and profitability will require additional expansion of sales in other markets, most notably the north american market.  to the extent that gridsense is unable to expand sales into other markets in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  in addition, even with the successful recruitment of additional personnel and international resellers, there can be no assurance that gridsense will be successful in maintaining or increasing international market demand for its products.   exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of gridsense’s australian operations. gridsense has operations in both the u.s. and australia. its australian operations are subject to the volatility of the australian dollar vis-à-vis the u.s. dollar (in 2012, the australian dollar strengthened by 2.2%, in 2011 the australian dollar was virtually unchanged vis-a-vis the u.s. dollar while in 2010, the australian dollar strengthened by 13.3%).  while risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that gridsense’s australian operation’s sales and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars, currency fluctuations may impact the translation of certain balance sheet items, affect the economics of manufacturing and ultimately affect its financial performance. during 2012, gridsense transferred substantially all of its production lines to the u.s. in order to minimize costs in australian dollars. gridsense does not employ specific strategies, such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging, to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures.   gridsense’s market is subject to rapidly changing technologies. gridsense markets its products in a field where electronics and software/firmware dominate. this fast changing area may generate unknown methods of detecting and monitoring disturbances that could render gridsense’s technology inferior, resulting in gridsense’s results of operations being materially adversely affected. gridsense does, however, closely monitor trends and changes in technologies and customer demand that could adversely impact its competitiveness and overall success.   gridsense is subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories.   some of gridsense’s competitors in the markets it serves are larger, better capitalized and have greater resources than gridsense. as gridsense grows and penetrates markets where larger companies have been established, it may experience a reduced rate of growth due to competitive forces.  competition from these competitors may have a material adverse effect on our operations, including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business. some competitors such as power delivery product, sentient and cooper have products that directly compete with gridsense at comparable price points and features. gridsense development costs and marketing costs to penetrate the market related to grid insitetm may be more than previously estimated. gridsense is currently in the process of developing grid insitetm. this product allows customers to monitor their networks on a system hosted by gridsense. while development costs expended to date are in line with expectations, we have no assurance that the final grid insitetm  product will be completed within the expected time frame or budget currently anticipated. we further have no assurance that following the development of grid insitetm, that gridsense will successfully be able to integrate it into its portfolio of products and be able to commercialize the applications. furthermore, grid insitetm may require different organizational skillset and resources to penetrate the market. in contrast to gridsense's traditional way of selling hardware and equipment, grid insitetm may give the company an opportunity to sell services and generate recurring revenue streams over time.  this model may require upfront investment by the company which will be recovered through subscription revenue collected overtime. as with any new product introduction there is always a risk in pace of adoption by customers.  grid insitetm represents a new and unconventional way to sell to utilities. while the gridsense believes that there is a market for hosted software solutions it is unknown how utilities will accept this new method of procuring services. risks related to omnimetrix omnimetrix has incurred net losses since our acquisition and may never achieve sustained profitability.   omnimetrix incurred a net loss of $2.6 million in 2012 since our acquisition of it and used $2.2 million of cash in its operations.  we believe that omnimetrix will continue to report losses in 2013 and have negative cash from operations. we can  25 table of contents provide no assurance that omnimetrix will be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to eventually sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows. omnimetrix current business model is predicated on the penetration rate of its pg monitoring units into the pg market. omnimetrix currently provides its pg monitoring units at minimal or no costs to certain customers in order to accelerate the penetration rate. accordingly, it does not cover its hardware costs on these units and depends on these customers maintaining their monitoring service connections to fund the company's future working capital needs. this new business model has not yet been proven to be sustainable. if the pace of demand for these pg units is greater than our expectations, omnimetrix will need additional working capital to finance its inventory requirements. if the pace of the demand for these pg units is below our expectations, the service monitoring revenue received from these units may not be enough to cover the fixed expenses of the company. an increase in customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing omnimetrix revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base. omnimetrix's rate of customer terminations, or average customer "churn"  in the 2012 period since our acquisition of them was 1%. our churn rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service. other factors, including increased competition from other providers, alternative technologies, and adverse business conditions may also influence our churn rate. if we have an increase in our churn rate, we will have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. as a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. if our churn rate increases, we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues. we incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers, our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be affected.      omnimetrix is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.   some of omnimetrix's current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with omnimetrix's existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. omnimetrix may not be able to access sufficient capital to support growth. since our acquisition of omnimetrix in february 2012, we invested $2.5 million to support their growth and working capital needs. omnimetrix is dependent on acorn's ability and willingness to provide funding to support its business and growth strategy. we have committed to an additional investment of $3.0 million to omnimetrix in 2013 (see liquidity and capital resources). omnimetrix will be competing with other acorn subsidiaries for access to acorn capital and credit support. whether acorn will have the resources necessary to provide funding, or whether alternative funds, such as third-party loans, will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to acorn and omnimetrix cannot be determined. additional support to omnimetrix may be in the form of a bank line, new investment by others, additional investment by acorn, or a combination of the above. omnimetrix is currently in discussions with a bank to provide working capital financing. we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms.  the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies. omnimetrix is dependent on the services of certain key personnel. omnimetrix's success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of its senior management team and other key personnel.  in particular, its success depends on the continued efforts of deena redding, its ceo, and harold jarrett, its cto who is both a founder and its most experienced engineer. the loss of the services of either of these key employees could materially harm omnimetrix's business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.  omnimetrix does not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on its employees other than for mr. jarrett. although to date omnimetrix has been successful in retaining the  26 table of contents services of senior management and has entered into employment agreements with ms. redding and mr. jarrett, they may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods.  omnimetrix may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for its senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available. omnimetrix has substantially increased its personnel count and related expense since our acquisition and whether sales can support the increased overhead cannot be determined. following acorn's acquisition of omnimetrix, the number of employees grew from 12 to 27 during 2012; in particular it increased the sales team to a total of 8 full time professionals. although the sales team's compensation is partially commission-based, it still incurs fixed base compensation and both variable and fixed employee benefit expenses. whether future operations can support the increased personnel costs cannot yet be determined and in the interim, operating expenses are expected to significantly out pace revenues. omnimetrix sells equipment and services which monitor third-party products, thus its revenues are dependent on the continued sales of such third-party products.      omnimetrix's end-user customer base is comprised exclusively of parties who have chosen to purchase either generators or cathodic protection systems. omnimetrix has no ability to control the rate at which new generators or cp protection systems are acquired. when purchases of such products decline, the associated need for omnimetrix's products and services is expected to decline as well. if omnimetrix is unable to keep pace with changing market or customer-mandated product and service improvements, omnimetrix's results of operations and financial condition may suffer.   many of omnimetrix's existing products may require ongoing engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs.  there can be no assurance that omnimetrix will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. the cellular networks used by omnimetrix are also subject to periodic technical updates that may require corresponding updates to, or replacement of, omnimetrix's monitoring equipment. cellular networks have evolved over time to offer more robust technical capabilities in both voice and data transmission. at the present time, the changes from the so-called “2g” to “3g” and “4g” service have resulted in only limited service interruptions. omnimetrix anticipates, however, that as these new capabilities come online, it will be necessary to have equipment that can readily interface with the newer cellular networks to avoid negative impacts on customer service. not all of the costs associated with omnimetrix's corresponding equipment upgrades can be passed on to customers and the increased expenses are expected to have a negative impact on omnimetrix's operating results. a substantial portion of omnimetrix's revenues are expected to be generated not from product sales, but from periodic monitoring fees and thus it is continually exposed to risks associated with its customers' financial stability. omnimetrix sells on-going monitoring services to both pg and cp customers. it is therefore dependent on these customers continuing to timely pay service fees on an on-going basis. if a significant portion of these fees are not renewed from year-to-year, omnimetrix can expect to experience deterioration in its financial condition. omnimetrix's ability to provide, and to collect revenues from, monitoring services is dependent on the reliability of cellular networks not controlled by omnimetrix. omnimetrix provides monitoring services through the use of cellular technology utilizing the networks of third-party providers. these providers generally do not warrant their services to either omnimetrix or the end users and any dropped transmissions could result in the loss of customer renewals and potential claims against omnimetrix. while omnimetrix uses contractual measures to limit its liability to customers, there is no assurance that such limitations will be enforced or that customers will not cancel monitoring services due to network issues. omnimetrix's business is dependent on its ability to reliably store and manage data, but there can be no guarantee that it has sufficient capabilities to mitigate potential data loss in all cases.  27 table of contents the efficient operation of omnimetrix's business is dependent on its information technology systems. in addition, omnimetrix's ability to assist customers in analyzing data related to the performance of such customers' power and cathodic protection monitoring systems is an important component of its customer value proposition. omnimetrix utilizes off-site data servers, housed within a commercial data center utilizing accepted data and power monitoring and protection processes, but whether a data loss can be avoided cannot be assured in every case. omnimetrix's information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, sabotage (including theft and attacks by computer viruses or hackers), power outages; and computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure. any interruption of omnimetrix's information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. omnimetrix is currently dependent on a single subcontractor for the assembly of its products for large bulk orders. omnimetrix's ability to deliver its products to its customers on a timely basis is dependent on the production processes of its selected subcontractor. financial or production difficulties by such subcontractor following the placement of a large order could have a negative impact on omnimetrix's ability to deliver its products timely and cause a loss of customer confidence.  although more than one subcontractor is qualified to produce omnimetrix components, omnimetrix may not be able to successfully make a change in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. any difficulties omnimetrix encounters as a result of its reliance on this subcontractor could have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition. current omnimetrix internal systems are not robust enough to sustain our anticipated growth and we will face challenges in implementing new systems and training users while maintaining our culture and product standards since we acquired omnimetrix, the workforce has increased substantially and our product platform has expanded to include preventative analytics.  we are in the process of moving into a new office and assembly facility and if our sales plans meet anticipated goals, both our hardware sales volume and customer monitoring contracts will increase, placing greater demands on both personnel and financial reporting systems.  we have recently hired a chief information officer to help us expand and update  the necessary information technology (it) platform and we are working internally to refine our sales, procurement and customer service functions.  whether we will be able to successfully keep pace with anticipated growth cannot be determined, and our failure to properly execute on the infrastructure initiatives we have underway could materially and negatively impact our financial performance if we are unable to meet customer demands.  while we believe our current financial reporting systems are adequate, we are also transitioning to more automated procedures and any failure during the transition or otherwise in implementing new accounting software could result in our inability to provide timely and accurate financial information. risks related to ussi   ussi has a limited operating history.   ussi was formed in november 2007 and has a limited operating history.  many of its products are at a research and development stage and substantial time, effort and financial resources will be required before it can become profitable.  ussi’s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, especially one that is dependent on developing new products for the oil and gas and security industries.  the likelihood of ussi’s success should be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business such as uncertainty in product development,  uncertainty in market acceptance of its products, competition, and changes in business strategy.  ussi has no assurance that it will be successful in its business activities.  ussi has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability.   since its inception, ussi has had annual operating losses. ussi expects to continue to have operating losses for the year ending december 31, 2013 and possibly beyond as a result of increased operating expenses required to commence manufacturing and production and to expand its sales and marketing operations. ussi can provide no assurance that it will ultimately generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable, to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows.   ussi will need additional financing to grow its business and finance its operations.   in the period since acorn's initial investment in november 2009 through december 2012, we have invested $14.75 million directly in ussi. in february 2013, we committed to an additional investment of $5.0 million in ussi (see recent developments). while ussi has reached agreement with a bank for a $1 million line-of-credit in 2012, we have no assurance that ussi’s future capital needs will not exceed the amount of the credit line or the amounts of acorn's new investment commitment  28 table of contents to ussi or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow in the future to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources.  furthermore, we have no assurance whether and to what extent ussi will have access to the entire $1.0 million bank facility given that the availability is subject to certain financial and other covenants. ussi may need to raise additional funds if revenues fail to meet projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies.  if additional funds are raised through the direct issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to third parties, acorn’s percentage ownership of ussi may be reduced. in addition, should additional funds be needed, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to ussi.  if funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, ussi may not be able to fund its growth, respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities.  accordingly, this could materially and adversely affect ussi’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   ussi is a small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.   some of ussi’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than does ussi. as a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with ussi’s existing and potential customers. they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than can ussi to its products, which would allow them to respond more quickly than ussi to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.   if ussi is unable to keep pace with technological change, ussi’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may suffer.   many of ussi’s products are in the research and development stage.  in addition, some of ussi’s existing products may require additional engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs.  there can be no assurance that ussi will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. ussi has not yet proved its ability to manufacture its products in commercial quantities.  in order to be successful, ussi's products must be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost and must meet the specifications required by the customers regarding quality.  we believe that ussi's space and manufacturing capabilities at its current facilities in chatsworth, california to be sufficient to handle a large increase in sales for the future.  ussi has increased its production staff and has purchased automation, control and tracking systems necessary to support larger scale production, but such systems have either not yet been fully tested or are not yet fully operational.  in addition to adding internal staffing and resources, ussi may consider potential opportunities to acquire third party manufacturing capacity through acquisition or contract manufacturing arrangements, and whether or when any will exist on terms acceptable to ussi cannot be determined. whether such systems and the personnel with the skills to effectively operate them can be put in place to meet customer orders on a timely and high quality basis can also not be determined.  failure to do so could result in delays or failures in meeting customer demand, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and orders.  such difficulties could materially and adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of ussi. ussi is dependent on suppliers who provide it with key components for some of its products.   ussi's products incorporate “state of the art” technologies.  as such, in many cases there are a limited number of suppliers of key components.  in particular, ussi currently relies on a single source for the development of its high-end interrogators for some of its technologically advanced product offerings.  ussi has licensed very advanced technology from northrop grumman that was initially developed for u.s. navy fiber optic sonar applications and intends to field its own high performance interrogator in 2013. while ussi is confident that it will be able to introduce the new interrogator in 2013, any development delays could materially and adversely affect ussi's business, results of operations and financial condition. where possible, ussi attempts to develop secondary back-up suppliers for key components.   ussi’s targeted customers may be reluctant to try its alternative solution despite its increased reliability and lower cost.   potential customers may elect to continue to use the existing expensive and less reliable technologies given their familiarity of the existing products in the market.  the competition in ussi’s markets may have superior resources and marketing ability which could lead to potential customers selecting existing products over ussi’s products. while ussi continues to develop its products and invest in marketing efforts accordingly, there is no assurance that ussi’s products will be preferred in the market  29 table of contents place relative to the competition with superior overall resources.  if the market place does not adopt ussi’s products as anticipated, ussi’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. failure to accurately forecast costs of future fixed-priced contracts could reduce ussi’s margins.   ussi's current proof-of-concept projects which generally produce negative gross margins due to non-recurring engineering design costs ("nre") associated with the proof-of-concept are expected to lead to follow-on projects on a fixed price basis. when working on a fixed-price basis, ussi expects to undertakes to deliver solutions to a customer’s specifications or requirements for a particular project.  the profits from these projects are expected to primarily be determined by ussi’s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs.  costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors, including underestimating costs, difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract.  if, for any reason, ussi’s costs are substantially higher than expected, ussi may incur losses on such fixed-price contracts. ussi may lose sales if it is unable to obtain government authorization to export its products. the export of some of ussi’s products may be subject to export controls imposed by the u.s. government and administered by the u.s. departments of state and commerce. in certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department.  for products subject to the export administration regulations (“ear”) administered by the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination and the identity of the end user.  all ussi products that are exported are subject to ear; however, most of ussi’s equipment is considered ear99.  ear99 items generally consist of low-technology consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations. however, if ussi were to attempt to export an ear99 item to an embargoed country, to an end-user of concern (as defined by the u.s. department of commerce) or in support of a prohibited end-use (as defined by the u.s. department of commerce), ussi would be required to obtain a license. exports of certain ussi products may also be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations (“itar”) regulations administered by the department of state’s directorate of defense trade controls and may require a license.   certain proposed exports of products and technical data by ussi to dsit in connection with the pauss project and related projects will require either an ear or itar license and it cannot be determined at this time if licenses will issue at all, on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. obtaining export licenses generally can be difficult and time-consuming. failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect ussi’s business, financial condition and results of operations. compliance with u.s. government regulations may also subject ussi to additional fees and costs. the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect ussi’s competitive position. limited protection of proprietary technology; risks of infringement   ussi’s success is heavily dependent upon its internally developed technology.  ussi has filed patents covering the specific use and novel inventions developed internally.  to further protect its proprietary rights, ussi relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions.  as part of its confidentiality procedures, ussi enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees, as well as select consultants and strategic partners and limit access to and distribution of its designs and proprietary information.  despite these efforts, ussi may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights.  in addition, the expense associated with the enforcement of ussi’s proprietary rights may be substantial.   risks related to our securities   our stock price is highly volatile.   the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. during 2012, our common stock has closed at prices as low as $6.35 and as high as $12.84 per share. fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including:   • general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy;  30 table of contents • quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results; • announcements of changes in our senior management; • the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers; • announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers or us; • the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets; • changes in our dividend policy; • changes in accounting rules; • changes in investor perceptions; or • changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers. in addition, the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile. this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.   our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options.   almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are, or could upon exercise of options or warrants would become, eligible for sale in the public market as described below.  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect our stock price.   as of march 7, 2013, 18,071,560 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding.  as of that date we had 23,000 warrants outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.68 and 1,008,188 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $4.40 per share, which if exercised would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.  in addition to the options noted above, at march 1, 2013, 324,670 options are outstanding, but have not yet vested and are not yet exercisable.    31 table of contents item 1b. unresolved
