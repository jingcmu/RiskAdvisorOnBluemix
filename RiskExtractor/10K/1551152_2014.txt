item 1a.    risk factors         you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10-k in evaluating abbvie and abbvie's common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvie's results of operations or financial condition. the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to abbvie's business, risks related to abbvie's separation from abbott and risks related to abbvie's common stock. based on the information currently known to it, abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. however, the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also 12 adversely affect its business. in addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.         if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's business, financial condition or results of operations. in such case, the trading price of abbvie's common stock could decline. risks related to abbvie's business the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvie's future revenues and operating income.         abbvie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of its products. in particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in abbvie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states. patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of abbvie's products.         as patents for certain of its products expire, abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products. the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. if abbvie's competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's business and results of operations. in addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. any such proposals that are enacted into law could worsen the effect of generic competition.         abbvie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1, "businessintellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity" and item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsresults of operations," and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3, "legal proceedings." the united states composition of matter patent for humira, which is abbvie's largest selling product and had worldwide sales of approximately $10.7 billion in 2013, is expected to expire in december 2016, and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in april 2018. because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted, it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira. abbvie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect abbvie's future revenues and operating income.         third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvie's patents and patent applications. for example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, abbreviated new drug applications (andas) with the united states food and drug administration (fda) seeking to market generic forms of abbvie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed.         although most of the challenges to abbvie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. for example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. in addition, certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as hiv/aids. if triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvie's results of operations. 13         abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. patent litigation and other challenges to abbvie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product. to the extent abbvie's intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively, abbvie's business will suffer. to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvie's intellectual property, abbvie's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. a third party's intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvie's future profitability and financial condition.         third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property. resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements. abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected abbvie product or products. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's profitability and financial condition. any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvie's results of operations and cash flows.         humira generates approximately 57 percent of abbvie's sales. any significant event that adversely affects humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvie's operations and cash flows. these events could include loss of patent protection for humira, the approval of biosimilars of humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments, and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason. abbvie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.         to remain competitive, abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvie's revenue and profitability. accordingly, abbvie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. for example, in 2012 abbvie discontinued the development of abt-263, which was in phase ii development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standard of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.         decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. more 14 detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvie's future results.         even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. abbvie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvie's products to become obsolete, causing abbvie's revenues and operating results to suffer. a portion of abbvie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.         abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. for example, abbvie is collaborating with biogen idec to develop a treatment for the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis. it is also collaborating with galapagos nv to discover, develop, and commercialize a next-generation, oral janus kinase 1 (jak1) inhibitor in phase ii development with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases.         failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to abbvie, or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on abbvie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. in addition, abbvie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration. biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.         the successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. for example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited, and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. in addition, the development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding humiracould adversely impact abbvie's business and results of operations. 15 new products and technological advances by abbvie's competitors may negatively affect abbvie's results of operations.         abbvie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market, and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. for example, humira competes with a number of anti-tnf products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvie's virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other anti-hiv treatments. these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology, renal disease, dyslipidemia, and neuroscience. abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie's products, and this could negatively impact abbvie's business and results of operations. abbvie's biologic products may become subject to competition from biosimilars.         the biologics price competition and innovation act was passed on march 23, 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act. the law created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. in europe, the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. in addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvie's biologic products. if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie's biologic products, abbvie's products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. expiration or successful challenge of abbvie's applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. as a result, abbvie could face more litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. the manufacture of many of abbvie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvie's products, abbvie's business could suffer.         the manufacture of many of abbvie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for abbvie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters, and environmental factors. if problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. this could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. 16 abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvie's business and results of operations.         abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. the failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect abbvie's business and results of operations. finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvie's use of such alternatives. abbvie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's revenues and financial condition.         pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing phase iv trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. for example, abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. if serious safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities. safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvie's products.         new data about abbvie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for abbvie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvie's products. abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations.         in the ordinary course of business, abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on abbvie's business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income and exposure to other claims. product liability losses are self-insured. product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's business and results of operations. 17 abbvie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.         cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1, "businessregulationcommercialization, distribution, and manufacturing." to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, abbvie's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. in the united states, the european union and other countries, abbvie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.         in the united states, practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid, including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act, contribute to pricing pressures. recently enacted changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures.         in numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. consequently, in those markets, abbvie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. in particular, many european countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe. differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in abbvie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating income. abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.         abbvie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities, as described in item 1, "businessregulationdiscovery and clinical development." the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.         in addition, abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. these requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations.         possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of abbvie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvie's or its suppliers' facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. any of these events could disrupt abbvie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 18 laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.         the health care industry is subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse. in the united states, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the medicaid rebate statute, the veterans health care act, and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including medicare, medicaid, and veterans administration health programs. these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. in addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt abbvie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalties and/or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal health care programs, if it fails to comply with the terms of the may 7, 2012 resolution of the department of justice's investigation into sales and marketing activities for depakote.         on may 7, 2012, abbott settled united states federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the food drug & cosmetic act (fdca) and agreeing to pay approximately $700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately $900 million to resolve civil claims. under the plea agreement, abbott submitted to a term of probation that was initially set at 5 years, but was shortened to 3 years upon the separation of abbott and abbvie. the obligations of the plea agreement have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie. the conditions of probation include certain reporting requirements, maintenance of certain compliance measures, certifications of abbvie's ceo and board of directors, and other conditions. if abbvie violates the terms of its probation, it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate. on october 2, 2012, the court accepted the guilty plea and imposed the agreed-upon sentence.         in addition, abbott entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (cia) with the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services (oig). the effective date of the cia is october 11, 2012. the obligations of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie. the cia requires enhancements to abbvie's compliance program, fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations, management certifications, and resolutions from abbvie's board of directors, among other requirements. compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on abbvie, including in the form of employee training, third party reviews, compliance monitoring, reporting obligations, and management attention. if abbvie fails to comply with the cia, the oig may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs, including medicare and medicaid. abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement, and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of abbott's costs. the international nature of abbvie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.         abbvie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. sales outside of the united states make up approximately 46 percent of abbvie's net sales. the risks associated with its operations outside the united states include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 19  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvie's ability to manufacture, market, and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-u.s. countries, including in europe;  compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act. events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on abbvie's revenues and profitability. abbvie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.         abbvie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.         additionally, changes in abbvie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. 20 abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties.         in 2013, three wholesale distributorsamerisourcebergen corporation, cardinal health, inc. and mckesson corporationaccounted for substantially all of abbvie's sales in the united states. if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie, and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact abbvie's business and results of operations. changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's operations.         rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service medicaid or medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvie's operations. abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations.         the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors. these consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of abbvie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvie's business. to the extent that abbvie incurs additional indebtedness, these risks could increase. in addition, abbvie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and abbvie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.         abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. for example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect abbvie's business. if abbvie raises additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, its stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvie's business. abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvie's business.         abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business. these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or 21 breakdown. although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvie's information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvie's business. other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvie's profitability and financial condition.         many other factors can affect abbvie's profitability and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of abbvie's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the commercial and credit environment that may adversely affect abbvie's ability to finance its business operations;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbvie or its employee benefit trusts; and  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. risks related to abbvie's separation from abbott abbvie's historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.         abbvie's separation from abbott was completed on january 1, 2013. therefore, the historical information about abbvie in this annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012 and for the periods ending prior to december 31, 2012 refers to abbvie's business as operated by and integrated with abbott. abbvie's historical financial information for these periods is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of abbott. accordingly, the financial information for these periods does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that abbvie would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that abbvie will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:  prior to the separation, which occurred on january 1, 2013, abbvie's business was operated by abbott as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. abbott or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for abbvie, such as accounting, information technology, and finance. abbott currently provides some of these functions to abbvie. abbvie's historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from abbott for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses abbvie would have incurred had it operated as a separate publicly traded company. following the separation and the date on which abbvie ceases to receive services from abbott pursuant to 22 transition services agreements, abbvie may not be able to operate its business at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline;  prior to the separation, abbvie was able to use abbott's size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. as a separate, independent company, abbvie may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation, which could decrease abbvie's overall profitability;  generally, abbvie's working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of abbott. as a result of the separation, abbvie may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements; and  the cost of capital for abbvie's business may be higher than abbott's cost of capital prior to the separation.         for additional information about the past financial performance of abbvie's business and the basis of presentation of the financial statements of abbvie's business, see item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." as abbvie builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, abbvie could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.         abbvie expects to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. abbvie may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from abbott's existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions as abbvie replaces these systems. abbvie may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data, and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. abbvie's failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces abbott's information technology services, or its failure to implement the new systems and replace abbott's services successfully, could disrupt its business, adversely affect its ability to collect receivables from customers, and have a material adverse effect on its profitability. in addition, if abbvie is unable to replicate or transition certain systems, its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired. abbott may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation or abbvie may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.         in connection with the separation, abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements, including transition services agreements, a tax sharing agreement, international commercial operations agreements, finished goods supply agreements, contract manufacturing agreements, an employee matters agreement, a special products master agreement, an information technology agreement, and a transitional trademark license agreement. certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after abbvie's separation from abbott. abbvie relies on abbott to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. if abbott is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, abbvie could incur operational difficulties or losses. 23         in addition, abbvie and abbott entered into long-term arrangements under a special products master agreement relating to certain product rights and into an ex-u.s. transition services agreement for abbott to provide abbvie with back office functions and other services in certain markets outside the united states until abbvie has established sufficient back office infrastructure to conduct operations in such markets. these arrangements could lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbvie's rights to certain intellectual property and territorial commercialization rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for abbvie's products and operations outside of the united states.         if abbvie does not have in place its own systems and services, or if abbvie does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction or long-term agreements terminate, abbvie may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline. abbvie is in the process of creating its own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services abbott currently provides to it. abbvie may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from abbott's systems to abbvie's. these systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services abbott is expected to provide during the transition period.         abbvie will be developing and implementing its own back office functions, administrative systems, personnel, and processes for markets outside the united states where abbott will initially provide such functions. there can be no assurance that abbvie will be able to implement such functions effectively and without disrupting its business in those markets. potential indemnification liabilities to abbott pursuant to the separation agreement could materially adversely affect abbvie.         the separation agreement with abbott provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between abbvie and abbott with respect to and resulting from the separation. among other things, the separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities, except certain tax liabilities, that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after abbvie's separation from abbott, as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation agreement, including those relating to depakote. if abbvie is required to indemnify abbott under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement, abbvie may be subject to substantial liabilities. abbvie may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions during the two-year period following the distribution.         to preserve the tax-free treatment to abbott of the separation and the distribution, under the tax sharing agreement that abbvie entered into with abbott, abbvie is restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for united states federal income tax purposes. under the tax sharing agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, abbvie is prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:  entering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 25 percent or more of its stock or substantially all of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;  merging, consolidating, or liquidating;  issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;  repurchasing its capital stock; and  ceasing to actively conduct its business. 24         these restrictions may limit abbvie's ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business. in addition, under the tax sharing agreement, abbvie is required to indemnify abbott against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of abbvie's stock or assets, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. certain of abbvie's executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at abbott.         because of their former positions with abbott, certain of these executive officers and directors own abbott common shares, options to purchase abbott common shares or other equity awards. even though abbvie's board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, and abbvie's executive officers who were formerly employees of abbott ceased to be employees of abbott, some abbvie executive officers and directors continue to have a financial interest in abbott common shares. in addition, four of abbvie's directors currently serve on the board of directors of abbott. continuing ownership of abbott common shares and equity awards, or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if abbvie and abbott pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for abbvie and abbott. abbvie may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation.         abbvie may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from its separation from abbott because, among other things: (a) abbvie may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of abbott; and (b) abbvie's business is less diversified than abbott's business prior to the separation. if abbvie fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial conditions, and results of operations of abbvie could be adversely affected. risks related to abbvie's common stock abbvie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock.         although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvie's board of directors. the board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as abbvie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that the board deems relevant. for more information, see item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities." abbvie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. abbvie cannot guarantee that it will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if abbvie commences paying dividends. your percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future.         in the future, your percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions, or other purposes. abbvie's employees will have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to abbvie stock options. abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of abbvie's common stock. 25 from time to time, abbvie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under abbvie's employee benefits plans.         in addition, abbvie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue, without the approval of abbvie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over abbvie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as abbvie's board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvie's common stock. for example, abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. certain provisions in abbvie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie, which could decrease the trading price of abbvie's common stock.         abbvie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include, among others:  the inability of abbvie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of abbvie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of abbvie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on abbvie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 percent of abbvie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of abbvie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions.         in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation's outstanding voting stock.         abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvie's board of directors and by providing abbvie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvie's stockholders. these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 26 cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements         this annual report on form 10-k contains certain forward
