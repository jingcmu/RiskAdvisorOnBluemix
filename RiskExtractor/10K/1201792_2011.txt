item 1a. risk factors   investing in our common stock has a high degree of risk. before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business   if we are unable to continue our recent revenue and earnings growth, our stock price may decline and we may not have adequate financial resources to execute our business plan.   our revenue increased 39% from $107.1 million in 2008 to $149.0 million in 2009, and it increased 33% from $149.0 million in 2009 to $198.2 million in 2010, primarily due to strong referrals from current students, new student marketing, and the variety and affordability of our program offerings. the same factors that led to the growth in revenues also contributed to our net income improving to $29.9 million in 2010 from $23.9 million in 2009. the rate of revenue growth from 2009 to 2010 was at a lower pace than the rate of growth from 2008 to 2009. as our revenue base has grown, our growth rate percentages have declined, and it may continue to decline. you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance. if we are unable to maintain adequate revenue and earnings growth, or if investors react negatively to the slowing of our growth rates, the value of our stock price may decline.   our growth may place a strain on our resources that could adversely affect our systems, controls and operating efficiency.   the growth that we have experienced in the past, as well as any future growth that we experience, may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls. we do not have experience scheduling courses and administering programs for more students than our current enrollment, and if growth negatively impacts our ability to do so, the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected, resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals. we also have limited experience adding to our courses, programs and operations through acquisitions. future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems, particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the higher education act of 1965, or the higher education act, as administered by the u.s. department of education, including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act, which we refer to in this annual report as title iv programs. we have described some of the most significant regulatory risks that apply to us, including those related to title iv programs, under the heading “risks related to the regulation of our industry” below. if we are unable to manage our growth or successfully carry out and integrate acquisitions, we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.     31   the ability of military students to enroll in our courses can be impacted by factors that we do not anticipate, which can impact our registrations and make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast expected enrollment. beginning with registrations for the third quarter of 2010, we observed that the growth of our net course registrations from active duty military students slowed more than we expected.  we do not know all of the factors that caused this to occur, and we cannot determine whether over time net course registrations from active duty military students will return to our previous expectations, continue to grow more slowly then expected, remain flat or decline.  we believe that the changes we saw in net course registrations from active duty military students were in part due to increased operations activity and overseas deployments across all branches of the us military, particularly the level of activity in the united states marine corps.  we believe that increased demands on many active duty military personnel, combined with limited internet access associated with some deployments, impacted the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education in 2010. due to the variability of military activity and other factors over which we have no control, the difficulty in predicting military enrollments that we encountered in 2010 could continue or become more pronounced. any decline in the enrollments, or decline in the growth of enrollments, from active duty military students could have an adverse impact on our total net course registrations and revenues. tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel constituted 50% of our net course registrations for 2010, and our revenues and number of students would decrease if we are no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or tuition assistance is reduced or eliminated.   service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of the armed forces that they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. service members of the united states armed forces can use tuition assistance at postsecondary schools that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the u.s. secretary of education. our tuition is currently structured so that tuition assistance payments for service members fully cover the service member’s per semester credit hour tuition cost of our undergraduate courses and cover more than 75% of the per course tuition cost of our graduate courses. if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated, our enrollments and revenues would be significantly reduced resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a recent congressional investigation of department of defense, or dod, tuition assistance programs used for distance education and proprietary institutions and a dod rulemaking that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active servicemembers could result in legislation that limits in whole or in part our participation in the tuition assistance program. see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on these developments.   strong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.   postsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive. we compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. public and private colleges and universities, as well as other for-profit schools, offer programs similar to those we offer. public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. accordingly, public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for-profit sector. in addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities and other for-profit schools, have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students, particularly in the non-military sector of the market. we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including established colleges and universities that have not previously offered online education programs. in addition, we believe that for-profit schools may increasingly be seeking to attract military students, including because these schools may see it as helpful in their efforts to comply with the 90/10 rule, as currently dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits do not count towards the 90% limit.   we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations. we may also face increased competition if our competitors pursue relationships with the military and governmental educational programs with which we already have relationships. these competitive factors could cause our enrollments, revenues and profitability to decrease significantly.   if we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our future growth may be impaired.   the updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers. if we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. to offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. in addition, effective july 1, 2011, under the new regulations published on october 29, 2010, we will have to seek approval from the u.s. department of education before introducing all new programs that prepare students for gainful employment. see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on these new program approval requirements. if we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.     32     establishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments in management, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. we may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to modify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. if we are unable to increase the number of students, or offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.   if we do not have adequate continued personal referrals and marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness among, attracting and retaining new students, our financial performance in the future would suffer.   building awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer among potential students is critical to our ability to attract new students. in order to maintain and increase our revenues and profits, we must continue to attract new students in a cost-effective manner and these students must remain active in our programs.  in addition, because we experience declines in our student population as a result of graduation, transfers to other academic institutions, military deployments and other reasons, in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those that have left amu or apu.  beginning in 2009 and continuing into 2010, we increased the amounts spent on marketing and advertising, and we anticipate this trend to continue, particularly as a result of our attempts to attract and retain students from non-military market sectors. we use marketing tools such as the internet, exhibits at conferences, and print media advertising to promote our schools and programs. additionally, we rely on the general reputation of amu and apu and referrals from current students, alumni and educational service officers in the united states armed forces as a source of new students. some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:     ● the emergence of more successful competitors;       ● factors related to our marketing, including the costs of internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;         ● limits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the new incentive payment rule (see “risks related to the regulation of our industry”);         ● performance problems with our online systems;       ● failure to maintain accreditation;       ● student dissatisfaction with our services and programs;       ● failure to develop a message or image that resonates well within non-military sectors of the market;       ● adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors or online or for-profit education generally;       ● adverse developments in our relationship with military educational service officers;       ● a decline in the acceptance of online education; and       ● a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs.   to continue to grow our enrollment, we expect to continue to increase the amounts that we spend on marketing and advertising as our traditional approach to marketing and advertising may not be able to sustain meaningful growth rates.  however, because we are smaller than most of our competitors and because our tuition is generally lower, we have fewer dollars available to spend on marketing and advertising than they do. accordingly, we may find it increasingly difficult to continue to compete and grow our enrollments. if we are unable to continue to develop awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain students in both military and non-military market sectors, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired.     33     system disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.   the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our online classroom, damaging our ability to generate revenue. our technology infrastructure could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist activities and telecommunications failures.   our systems, particularly those related to our partnership-at-a-distance, or pad, system, have been predominantly developed in-house, with limited support from outside vendors. we are continuously working on upgrades to the pad system, and our employees continue to devote substantial time to its development. to the extent that we face problems with the pad system, we may not have the capacity to address the problems with our internal capability, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system.   any failure of our online classroom system could also prevent students from accessing their courses. any interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.   our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. we engage multiple security assessment providers on a periodic basis to review and assess our security. we utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are continually monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure. however, we cannot assure you that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches.   we are in the midst of changing the third party software provider for our online classroom, which is a time-consuming and capital intensive process that may not be successful and in the interim could lead to our current provider ceasing to support our current system, any of which could adversely affect our students’ experience and our performance.   historically, our online classroom employed the educator™ learning management system pursuant to a license from ucompass.com, inc. the educator™ system is a web-based portal that stores and delivers course content, provides interactive communication between students and faculty, and supplies online evaluation tools. we currently rely on ucompass for ongoing support and customization and integration of the educator™ system with the rest of our technology infrastructure. we determined that it was in our long-term best interest to transition to a new online classroom that allows us to integrate additional technologies and resources, and in 2010 we began the transition process to a new online classroom based on the sakai platform.  our online classroom is central to our operations, and the process of switching our provider is complicated and time consuming.  we may underestimate the amount of time and capital that will be required to complete the transition and our management team could be distracted from focusing on other aspects of our business.  we expect to fully transition to the sakai platform by the fall of 2011. however, the new online classroom may not be well received by our current or future students, or problems with the new online classroom may not be evident to us until after we complete the switch.  any of the foregoing problems could result in an adverse impact on our operations, damage to our reputation and limits on our ability to attract and retain students. during the transition, if ucompass ceases to operate or is unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with service, we may have difficulty maintaining the software required for our online classroom or updating it for future technological changes, all of which would also have an adverse impact on our operations, cause damage to our reputation and limit our ability to attract and retain students. future growth or increased technology demands will require continued investment of capital, time and resources to develop and update our technology and if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources appropriately, our ability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.   we believe that continued growth will require us to increase the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure, including our pad system. increasing the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure will require us to invest capital, time and resources, and there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment our systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth. we may also need to invest capital, time and resources to update our technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace. if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources or update our resources appropriately, our ability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the loss of any key member of our management team may impair our ability to operate effectively and may harm our business.   our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business. except for the employment agreements we have with dr. boston, our president and chief executive officer, dr. mccluskey, our executive vice president and provost, dr. van wyk, our executive vice president and chief operations officer, and mr. wilkins, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, we do not have employment agreements with any of our other executive officers or key personnel, and dr. mccluskey has announced that he intends to retire as of march 17, 2011.     34     if we are unable to attract and retain management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed.   to execute our growth strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel. competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas. our growth places constant demands on us to find qualified individuals across all levels of our institution. since august 2009 we have hired a new chief operations officer and chief information officer, reflecting our continued need to also continue to expand and strengthen our management as we grow.  if we fail to attract new management, faculty, administrators or skilled personnel or fail to retain and motivate our existing management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed. the u.s. department of education’s revised incentive payment rule, which takes effect july 1, 2011, may affect the manner in which we attract, retain, and motivate new and existing employees. see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on this revised rule. if we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs or department of defense tuition assistance programs or have our participation in the title iv programs conditioned or limited.  we have been the target of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs, and as we continue to grow we may be susceptible to an increased risk of such activities. the potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of title iv program funds by apus, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our nature as an online education provider and our relatively low tuition. we must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.  we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with our growth.  the department of education requires institutions that participate in title iv programs to refer to the office of the inspector general of the department of education any credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer, or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the title iv programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving title iv programs, and in the past we have referred to the office of the inspector general information with respect to potential fraud by applicants. if the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the department of education may find that we do not satisfy its “administrative capability” requirements. this could result in our being limited in our access to, or our losing, title iv program funding, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations. see “regulation of our business” in this annual report for more information on the department of education’s regulations on administrative capability. in addition, our ability to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces is conditioned on our maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education. any significant failure to detect adequately fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause us to fail to meet our accrediting agencies’ standards. furthermore, under heoa, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs, as we do, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. failure to meet our accrediting agencies’ standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of our accrediting agencies, which could result in a loss of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces.  the protection of our operations through exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property is limited, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties, any of which could harm our operations and prospects.   in the ordinary course of our business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret or other protections. this intellectual property includes but is not limited to courseware materials and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies. we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names, agreements and registrations to protect our intellectual property. we rely on service mark and trademark protection in the united states and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to the marks “american military university,” “american public university,” “american public university system” and “educating those who serve,” as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. we rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third party content experts. we cannot assure you that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the united states or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content, and offer competing programs to ours.     35     in particular, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online resource material, quality management and other proprietary content. any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs.   we may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. in july 2006, we settled a dispute with another institution regarding the use of certain marks that allowed us to continue to use the marks at issue, but we may not be able to favorably resolve future disputes. some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. our general liability and cyber liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages, which may be significant. we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.   in some instances, our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third party content on class discussion boards. we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. our faculty members or students could also post classified material on class discussion boards, which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our reputation and relationships with members of the military and government. our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.   because we are an exclusively online provider of education, we are entirely dependent on continued growth and acceptance of exclusively online education and, if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.   we believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees from online institutions. if students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides value, or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. because our business model is based on online education, if the acceptance of online education does not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   if we do not maintain continued strong relationships with various military bases and educational service officers, and if we are unable to expand our use of articulation agreements, our future growth may be impaired.   we have non-exclusive articulation agreements or memoranda of understanding with various educational institutions of the united states armed forces and other governmental education programs. articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are agreements pursuant to which we agree to award academic credits toward our degrees for learning in educational programs offered by others. additionally, we rely on relationships with educational service offices on military bases and base education officers to distribute our information to interested service members. if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate or end, our efforts to recruit students from that base will be impaired. if our articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are eliminated, or if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate, this could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.   in august 2010, dod issued a proposed rule that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active servicemembers. the proposed rules would require all institutions to sign a memorandum of understanding, or mou, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and dod prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program. the requirements to enter into an mou and the related increased focus by the dod on relationships and oversight of educational providers could lead to changes in the nature of our relationships with military bases and educational service officers, which could be adverse in nature. the united states armed forces has in the past and may in the future approve programs and initiatives to provide additional educational opportunities to service members, and these programs and initiatives may not include participation by us. we cannot predict the impact of these announcements, programs or initiatives on us, but given our dependence on students from the armed forces, our net course registrations and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by such announcements, programs and initiatives.     36     government regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.   the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services have led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. these new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. new laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.   risks related to the regulation of our industry if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations, including loss of access to federal tuition assistance programs for members of the united states armed forces and federal loans and grants for our students.   we are subject to extensive regulation by (1) the federal government through the u.s. department of education and under the higher education act, (2) state regulatory bodies and (3) accrediting agencies recognized by the u.s. secretary of education. we are also regulated by the department of defense and the department of veterans affairs, the regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. these regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.   institutions of higher education that grant degrees, diplomas or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies. in addition, in certain states as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees and in order to participate in various federal programs, including tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces, a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education. accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution. the higher education act requires accrediting agencies recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution’s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency’s standards.   our operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in title iv programs. title iv programs, which are administered by the department of education, include loans made directly to students by the department of education. title iv programs also include several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the higher education act and department of education regulations. to participate in title iv programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education. our growth strategy is partly dependent on enrolling more students who are attracted to us because of our continued participation in these programs.   the regulations, standards and policies of the department of education, state education agencies, and our accrediting agencies change frequently. recent and impending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, activities, receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces, our ability to participate in title iv programs, or costs of doing business. furthermore, findings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages, or being subjected to fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our operations, termination of our ability to grant degrees, revocation of our accreditation, restrictions on our access to title iv program funds or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business.   if we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and also to participate in title iv programs.   american public university system is accredited by the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools, one of six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education, and by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council, or detc, which is a national accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education. accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education is required for participation in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces. in 2010, we derived approximately 50% of our revenue from net course registrations from these tuition assistance programs. accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education for title iv purposes is also required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in title iv programs. american public university system achieved regional accreditation from the higher learning commission in 2006 and has had national accreditation from the distance education and training council since 1995. we have identified the higher learning commission as our primary accreditor for title iv purposes. either the higher learning commission or detc may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation. to remain accredited american public university system must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agencies. furthermore, many prospective students may view accreditation by a regional accrediting agency to be more prestigious than accreditation by a national accrediting agency, and we believe that loss of regional accreditation may reduce the marketability of american public university system even if national accreditation were maintained. the complete loss of accreditation would, among other things, render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces or title iv programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.     37   increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education and the u.s. congress may result in increased scrutiny of institutions, particularly proprietary institutions, by accrediting agencies, and if our institutional accrediting agency loses its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for title iv program purposes, we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs. in november and december 2009, the department of education’s office of the inspector general, oig, issued reports criticizing three regional accreditors – middle states commission on higher education, the southern association of colleges and schools, and the higher learning commission – for failing to define both program length and credit hours. oig, in an unusual action, recommended that the department of education consider limiting, suspending, or terminating the higher learning commission’s recognition as an accreditor for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in response, department of education staff conducted a special review of the higher learning commission and required the higher learning commission to accept a corrective action plan. the higher learning commission received additional scrutiny in june 2010 during a house education and labor committee hearing focused on oig’s findings with regard to credit hour policies. in december 2010, the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity, naciqi, the panel charged with advising the department of education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for title iv purposes, reviewed the higher learning commission’s status as a recognized accrediting agency. based on the higher learning commission’s response to the department’s special review and a december 2008 interim report (which responded to a 2007 naciqi review unrelated to the oig findings), naciqi voted to continue the higher learning commission’s recognition as an accrediting agency. the higher learning commission must submit an additional compliance report in one year. scrutiny of accrediting agencies and their accreditation of proprietary institutions is likely to continue. if the department of education were to limit, suspend, or terminate the higher learning commission’s recognition, we could lose our ability to participate in the title iv programs, unless and until we were able to obtain department of education approval to rely on detc accreditation for purposes of institutional eligibility to participate in the title iv programs. if we were unable to rely on detc accreditation in such circumstances, among other things, our students and our institution would be ineligible to participate in the title iv programs, and such consequence would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues and results of operations. in addition, increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education in connection with the department of education’s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies. furthermore, because the for-profit education sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it is possible that accrediting bodies would respond to that growth by adopting additional criteria, standards and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like us. for example, in june 2009, the higher learning commission adopted new policies related to institutional control, structure and organization.  part of the higher learning commission’s rationale for these changes was to better define the range of its oversight of transactions related to change of ownership at institutions. the new policies extend the higher learning commission’s oversight to transactions that change, or have the potential to change, the control of an institution or its fundamental structure and organization. under the new policies, the higher learning commission also now extends its oversight to defined changes that occur in a parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock, could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the higher learning commission and possible change from an accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks of these types of actions. in particular, the change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution’s ability to participate in title iv programs. for-profit institutions may also be less attractive acquisition candidates because the higher learning commission has enhanced its scrutiny of change in control transactions, obtained the explicit ability to move an institution from accredited status to candidate status, and will be examining more closely entities that own accredited institutions. new and anticipated regulations published by the u.s. department of education could result in regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business. on june 18, 2010, the department of education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“nprm”) in respect of many of the issues subject to the negotiated rulemaking process, other than the metrics for determining compliance with the gainful employment requirement.  on july 26, 2010, the department of education issued an nprm in respect of the gainful employment requirement.  on october 29, 2010, the department of education published final regulations concerning certain institutional eligibility issues (such as state authorization for postsecondary education institutions), definitional issues (such as the definition of “credit hour” for certain eligibility and other purposes), student eligibility issues (including the validity of high school diplomas), and other title iv provisions (such as incentive payment and misrepresentation), as well as final regulations to establish a process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation.  the final regulations are generally effective july 1, 2011.     38   the department of education has indicated that it plans to issue final regulations defining “gainful employment” in early 2011. the department of education must publish such final regulations before november 1, 2011, in order for the regulations to take effect on july 1, 2012. the department of education’s proposed regulations regarding a gainful employment definition would adopt specific metrics focused on ratios of annual loan payment to measures of income and on loan repayment rates. as proposed, those metrics would incorporate data from years prior to the date of calculation of the relevant measure, meaning that for some period after the effective date of the metrics, if the department of education does not phase in such effective date, results under the gainful employment metrics would reflect conduct that occurred before the gainful employment tests were known.   a number of the risk factors below address potential substantive concerns and risks with respect to the final and proposed regulations. with respect to the final regulations generally, and each of the regulations discussed in the risk factors below specifically, we cannot predict how the final regulations will be interpreted, or whether we will be able to comply with those requirements by the effective dates. we are continuing to evaluate the possible effect of the final and proposed rules on our business and will continue to monitor developments in this area, including whether the july 26, 2010, proposed rules defining gainful employment are changed by the department of education following public comment. compliance with any of these new rules, insufficient time to comply with them, or uncertainty that results from the rules being recently promulgated and the absence of past practice and limited guidance as to the implementation of these new rules could have an adverse impact on our enrollment, affect the manner in which we do business, increase our cost of doing business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. lack of clarity in the final rules or guidance by the department of education could result in uncertainties continuing for some period of time, and may require us to adopt overly-narrow practices until clarity is obtained, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected. a failure to meet standards regarding “gainful employment” may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in title iv programs. the department of education has proposed as part of its rulemaking to define the concept of “gainful employment” by adopting specific metrics focused on ratios of annual loan payment to measures of income and on loan repayment rates. if one or more of our programs fail to meet standards measuring whether an educational program leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, those programs could lose eligibility for title iv aid or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. under the department of education’s proposal, depending on whether a program met certain thresholds on each metric, that program would be fully eligible to participate in title iv programs, restricted, or ineligible. a fully eligible program (which met the stricter threshold on both metrics) would have no restrictions on its participation in title iv programs. a program that met the stricter standard on only one of the metrics would have to provide certain warnings and disclosures to students. a program that met only the minimum standard on one or both of the metrics would be restricted. restricted programs would have to provide annually to the department of education documentation from employers that the program aligns with those employers’ business needs, and the department of education would limit the program’s enrollment of title iv recipients to the average number of title iv recipients enrolled during the prior three award years.  ineligible programs (which fail to meet either metrics minimum threshold) could provide title iv aid to students enrolled in the program for the remainder of the award year and one additional award year, but the program would not be allowed to offer title iv aid to new students enrolling in the program. the department of education must publish final regulations defining “gainful employment” before november 1, 2011, in order for the regulations to take effect on july 1, 2012.    our failure to obtain department of education approval, where required, for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation could materially and adversely affect our business. on october 29, 2010, the department of education issued final regulations to establish a new process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. under the final regulations, which are effective july 1, 2011, an institution must notify the department of education at least 90 days before the first day of class when it intends to add a program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.  the institution may proceed to offer the program, unless the department of education advises the institution that the department of education must approve the program for title iv purposes. in addition, if the institution does not provide timely notice to the department of education regarding the additional program, the institution must obtain approval of the program for title iv purposes.  if the department of education denies approval, the institution may not award title iv funds in connection with the program. were the department to deny approval to one or more of our new programs, our business could be materially and adversely affected. furthermore, compliance with these new procedures could cause delay in our ability to offer new programs and put our business at a competitive disadvantage. compliance could also adversely affect our ability to timely offer programs of interest to our students and potential students and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.     39     our failure to comply with the department of education’s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions. if we pay a bonus, commission or other incentive payment in violation of applicable department of education rules, we could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education abolished the 12 existing safe harbors, effective july 1, 2011. we are in the process of reviewing our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangement to ensure that they are in compliance with the revised incentive payment rule by july 1, 2011. abolition of the safe harbors and other aspects of the new regulation may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments. the modified incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may affect negatively our ability to recruit and retain employees, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, the government accountability office has issued a report critical of the department of education’s enforcement of the incentive payment rule, and the department of education has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts. if the department of education determines that an institution violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to the department of education’s satisfaction. the department of education may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution’s participation in the title iv programs. the department of education may also seek to recover title iv funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. in addition, third parties may file “qui tam” or “whistleblower” suits on behalf of the department of education alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. such suits may prompt department of education investigations. particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the new incentive payment rule, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or department of education investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline and could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, among other things. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected our failure to comply with the department of education’s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in sanctions. the department of education may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education has expanded the activities that constitute a substantial misrepresentation, effective july 1, 2011. under the final regulation, an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to the secretary of education. the final regulations define misrepresentation as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, and they define a misleading statement as any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse. the final regulations define substantial misrepresentation as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to the person’s detriment. if the department of education determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the department of education may revoke an institution’s program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institution’s participation in the title iv programs, deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution, or initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or termination the institution’s participation in the title iv programs.  we expect that there could be an increase in our industry of administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation, which at a minimum would increase legal costs associated with defending such actions, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected.   failure to comply with the department of education’s credit hour requirements could result in sanctions. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education has defined “credit” hour for title iv purposes.  the credit hour is used for title iv purposes to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of title iv aid that an institution may disburse in a payment period. the final regulations define credit hour as an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and out of class and an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities. the final regulations also require institutional accreditors to review an institution’s policies, procedures, and administration of policies and procedures for assignment of credit hours. an accreditor must take appropriate actions to address an institution’s credit hour deficiencies and to notify the department of education if it finds systemic noncompliance or significant noncompliance in one or more programs. the department of education has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for title iv purposes, it may require the institution to repay the amount of title iv awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and, if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours, it may fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in title iv programs, as a result of which our business could be materially and adversely affected. failure to comply with the department of education’s state authorization rules could result in our students being ineligible for title iv programs.     40   to be eligible for title iv programs, an institution must be legally authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in which it is physically located. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education specified the type of state approvals that are acceptable for an institution to demonstrate that it is legally authorized by the state in which it is located. the department of education has indicated that institutions that are unable to obtain appropriate state authorization by july 1, 2011 may request an extension of the effective date of the regulation to july 1, 2012, and if necessary, an additional one-year extension to july 1, 2013. in addition, under the final rule, if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located, the institution must meet any state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state by july 1, 2011. states must also have mechanisms to take appropriate action against institutions and to respond to complaints. if the department of education determines that an institution does not have the required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a state, the institution could lose its ability to award title iv funds to students in that state. the new distance education rules could also lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices detrimental to institutions such as ours. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected. currently, american public university system is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission. in addition, we are authorized in numerous states to offer postsecondary distance education to students in those states. at this time we are assessing our compliance in relation to the new state authorization requirements, and we are also assessing whether the rules and regulations of the state of west virginia are sufficient for purposes of an institution such as ours to be able to comply with the new state authorization rules or whether action is required by us or the state of west virginia. if we were unable to comply with the new requirement by the july 1, 2011 deadline (or receive an extension), we could lose eligibility for the title iv programs. in addition, it is possible that west virginia and other states could, as a result of the limited amount of time for states to evaluate and implement the department of education’s final state authorization rule or otherwise, adopt standards that are detrimental to institutions such as ours. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.   if american public university system does not maintain its authorization in west virginia, our operations would be curtailed and we may not grant degrees. american public university system is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission to grants degrees, diplomas or certificates. the west virginia higher education policy commission may also take disciplinary action or revoke authorization if an institution’s bond is cancelled, if the institution fails to take corrective action to bring it into compliance with west virginia higher education policy commission policies, or if the owner is convicted for a felony or crime involving institution administration of title iv programs. under current law, if we were to lose our regional accreditation by the higher learning commission, we could continue our state authorization based on our national accrediting agency, detc, if the west virginia higher education policy commission finds that it is an acceptable alternative accrediting agency. if we were to lose accreditation from both accrediting agencies, or accreditation by detc is not an acceptable alternative accrediting agency in case of loss of the higher learning commission accreditation, the west virginia higher education policy commission may suspend, withdraw, or revoke our authorization. in addition, in order to maintain our eligibility for accreditation by the higher learning commission, we must remain headquartered and have a substantial presence in one of the states in its region, which includes west virginia. thus, if we were to lose our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission, we would be unable to provide educational services in west virginia, we would lose our eligibility for title iv programs, and we would lose our regional accreditation.   our failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.   various states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. several states assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. state regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. as such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators. american public university system has a physical presence in the commonwealth of virginia based on administrative offices in that state, and it is authorized by the state council of higher education for virginia. american public university system has established a regulatory relationship with 49 of the 50 states, plus the district of columbia, and we are in the process of confirming our compliance with the remaining state’s recently revised regulatory provisions. state laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. to the extent that we have obtained, or obtain in the future, additional authorizations or licensure, changes in state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education, the west virginia higher education policy commission, the higher learning commission or detc. if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. if we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, we may be the subject of injunctive actions or penalties. although we believe that the only state licensure or authorization that is necessary currently for american public university system to participate in the tuition assistance programs for the united states armed forces and in title iv programs is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission, loss of licensure or authorization in other states or the failure to obtain required licensures or authorizations could prohibit us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states, reduce significantly our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     41   under the department of education’s final regulations published on october 29, 2010, if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined the state, the institution will have to meet any state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state by july 1, 2011. the new requirement could lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices affecting the delivery of distance education to students located in those states. in the event we are found not to be in compliance with a state’s new or existing requirements for offering distance education within that state, the state could seek to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries, we may not be able to recruit students from that state, and may have to cease providing service to students in that state. in addition, under the new federal regulation, we could lose eligibility to offer title iv aid to students located in that state.   our experience with the title iv programs is limited, because we only began to participate in the programs in 2006, and our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with title iv programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth.   we first became certified to participate in title iv programs for classes beginning in november 2006. we expect a significant portion of our growth in enrollments and revenues to come from students who are utilizing funds from title iv programs. however, compliance with the requirements of the higher education act and title iv programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations, which require additional staff, contractual arrangements, systems and regulatory costs. we have limited demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements. if we fail to comply with any of these additional regulatory requirements, the department of education could, among other things, impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.   we must periodically seek recertification to participate in title iv programs, and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the department of education prior to seeking recertification, and our future success may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification.   an institution generally must seek recertification from the department of education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. the department of education may also review an institution’s continued eligibility and certification to participate in title iv programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways, such as the addition of certain types of new programs, or, in certain cases, changes to the academic credentials that it offers. in certain circumstances, the department of education must provisionally certify an institution, such as when it is an initial participant in title iv programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control. in 2006 we applied to participate in title iv programs for the first time and were provisionally certified for a period through june 30, 2007. we timely submitted our application for recertification, and the department of education granted us provisional certification through june 30, 2008. in may 2008, we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs. in august 2008, we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs. as required under department of education regulations, we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control. in connection with the department of education’s review of the change, we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation, including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change. on october 2, 2008, we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september 30, 2010. a provisionally certified institution must apply for and receive department of education approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. the department of education may withdraw the institution’s certification if it determines that the institution is not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in title iv programs. in 2010, we applied for recertification and, on july 2, 2010, we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december 31, 2014. if the department of education were to withdraw or not renew our certification to participate in title iv programs, our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. in addition, regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results.      42   government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us, any of which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our performance.   because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. for example, the department of education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in the title iv programs and the office of inspector general of the department of education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. in august 2010, the secretary of education announced in a letter to several members of congress that, in part in response to recent allegations against proprietary institutions of deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations, the department planned to strengthen its oversight of title iv programs through, among other approaches, increasing the number of program reviews by 50%, from 200 conducted in 2010 up to 300 reviews in 2011. if the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of title iv funding, injunctions or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit.   the u.s. congress recently commenced an examination of the for-profit postsecondary education sector that could result in legislation or additional department of education rulemaking that may limit or condition title iv program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.   in recent months, the u.s. congress has increased its focus on for-profit education institutions, including with respect to their participation in the title iv programs. since june 2010 the u.s. senate’s health, education, labor and pensions committee (“help committee”) has held hearings to examine the proprietary education sector. on august 5, 2010, we received a letter from senator tom harkin, chairman of the help committee, requesting documents as part of a review of matters related to for-profit postsecondary education institutions whose students receive federal student financial aid. we understand that the request was one of approximately thirty requests made to for-profit colleges in connection with the help committee’s review of matters related to for-profit colleges participating in title iv programs. in june 2010, the education and labor committee of the u.s. house of representatives held a hearing to examine accreditors’ standards and procedures pertinent to higher education institutions’ policies on credit hours and program length. during the hearing, some committee members voiced concerns about the growing proportion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions. on june 21, the chairmen of each of senate and house education committees, together with other members of congress, requested the government accountability office to conduct a review and prepare a report with recommendations regarding various aspects of the proprietary education sector, including recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud and abuse in title iv programs, and the degree to which proprietary institutions’ revenue is comprised of title iv and other federal funding sources.  on august 4, the government accountability office released a report based on a three-month undercover investigation of recruiting practices at proprietary institutions, which concluded that employees at a non-random sample of 15 proprietary institutions (which did not include american public university systems) made deceptive statements to students about accreditation, graduation rates, job placement, program costs, or financial aid. on november 30, 2010, the government accountability office issued a revised version of that report that corrected or further explained a number of the instances of allegedly deceptive conduct. we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal and other costs to respond to the congressional inquiry. we cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and reviews will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in title iv programs, or more vigorous enforcement of title iv requirements. to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition title iv program participation of proprietary schools or the amount of federal student financial aid for which proprietary school students are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected.   congressional examination of department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance education and proprietary institutions and pending rulemaking by the department of defense could result in legislative or regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business.   in recent months, the u.s. congress has increased its focus on department of defense (“dod”) tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions.  in september 2010, the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the u.s. house of representative’s armed services committee held a hearing titled “a question of quality and value:  department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance learning and for-profit colleges.”  witnesses and subcommittee members expressed concern about dod’s oversight of distance education programs, especially those offered by proprietary institutions.  in august 2010, dod issued a proposed regulation that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active duty servicemembers.  under the proposed regulations, the military installation voluntary education review program would be expanded to institutions offering instruction to servicemembers through distance education, and all institutions would be required to participate in the program. in addition, in december 2010, the senate help committee released a report entitled “benefitting whom? for-profit education companies and the growth of military educational benefits,” which raised questions about the growing share of dod tuition assistance received by proprietary institutions.     43   we cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, congressional hearings will affect dod’s current rulemaking or result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our participation in dod’s tuition assistance program or the title iv programs. members of congress have stated, both in committee hearings and in the help committee report, that congress should revise the 90/10 rule (which requires a proprietary institution to derive no more than 90% of its revenue from title iv program funds) to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educational benefits toward the 90% limit. to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition the participation of proprietary schools or distance education programs in dod tuition assistance programs or in title iv programs with respect to dod tuition assistance programs, or that limit or condition the amount of tuition assistance for which proprietary schools or distance education programs are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected. our regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit institutions.   we are one of a number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. in recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for-profit educational institutions. these investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations. these allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of other for-profit educational institutions, including american public university system. in addition, recent reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education. adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for-profit school sector or regarding us directly could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments, revenues and operating profit, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the department of education, congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including us. congress may change the law or reduce funding for title iv programs, which could reduce our student population, revenues and profit margin.   the higher education act comes up for reauthorization by congress approximately every five to six years. when congress does not act on complete reauthorization, there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization. on august 14, 2008, the higher education opportunity act, or heoa, was enacted. heoa reauthorizes the higher education act. additionally, congress reviews and determines appropriations for title iv programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process. in october 2009 the department of education published final regulations to implement heoa. those regulations were generally effective july 1, 2010, but many of the provisions of heoa were effective upon enactment. if our efforts to comply with heoa’s provisions are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions, we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds. in addition, there is no assurance that congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease title iv program funds available to students, including students who attend our institution. any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for title iv programs or the ability of our school or students to participate in these programs, would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment. such a decrease in enrollment would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. congressional action, including heoa, may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin. we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by congress or signed into law in the future. the reallocation of funding among title iv programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different title iv programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.   investigations by state attorneys general, congress and governmental agencies regarding relationships between loan providers and educational institutions and their financial aid officers may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs.   in recent years, the student lending practices of postsecondary educational institutions, financial aid officers and student loan providers have been subjected to several investigations by state attorneys general, congress and governmental agencies. these investigations concern, among other things, possible deceptive practices in the marketing of private student loans and loans provided by lenders pursuant to title iv programs. heoa contains new requirements pertinent to relationships between lenders and institutions. in particular, heoa requires institutions to have a code of conduct, with certain specified provisions, pertinent to interactions with lenders of student loans, prohibits certain activities by lenders and guaranty agencies with respect to institutions, and establishes substantive and disclosure requirements for lists of recommended or suggested lenders of federal and private student loans. in addition, heoa imposes substantive and disclosure obligations on institutions that make available a list of recommended lenders for potential borrowers. state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions. because of the evolving nature of these legislative efforts and various inquiries and developments, we can neither know nor predict with certainty their outcome or effects, or the potential remedial actions that might result from these or other potential inquiries. governmental action may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margins.     44   we are subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely title iv program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.   a school participating in title iv programs must calculate correctly the amount of unearned title iv program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. because we began to participate in title iv programs in 2006 and the final regulations published on october 29, 2010 include new rules applicable to return of title iv calculations, we have limited experience complying with these provisions. under department of education regulations, late returns of title iv program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution’s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance. if unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to repay title iv funds, post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education or otherwise be sanctioned by the department of education, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations.   a failure to demonstrate “financial responsibility” may result in the loss of eligibility by american public university system to participate in title iv programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   to participate in title iv programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the department of education, or post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions, such as provisional certification, additional reporting requirements or regulatory oversight, on its participation in title iv programs. the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in title iv programs. any obligation to post a letter of credit could increase our costs of regulatory compliance. if we were unable to secure a letter of credit, we would lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in addition to the obligation to post a letter of credit under certain circumstances, an institution that is determined by the department of education not to be financially responsible may be transferred from the “advance” system of payment of title iv funds, which allows the institution to obtain title iv program funds from the department of education prior to making disbursements to students, to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, which requires the institution to make title iv disbursements to students and seek reimbursement from the department of education. a change in our system of payment could increase our costs of regulatory compliance. if we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs, our students would lose access to title iv program funds for use in our institution, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military community and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.   a failure to demonstrate “administrative capability” may result in the loss of american public university system’s eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   department of education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in title iv programs. see “regulation of our business” in this annual report for more information on the department of education’s regulations on administrative capability.   if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other department of education regulations, the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds, transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs. if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education’s “administrative capability” requirements we could be limited in our access to, or lose, title iv program funding, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations. we rely on a third party to administer our participation in title iv programs and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   we only began to participate in the title iv programs in 2006, and we have not developed the internal capacity to handle without third-party assistance the complex administration of participation in title iv programs. global financial aid services, inc. assists us with administration of our participation in title iv programs, and if it does not comply with applicable regulations, we may be liable for its actions and we could lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in addition, if it is no longer able to provide the services to us, we may not be able to replace it in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of title iv programs, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operation.     45      we may lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs if our student loan default rates are too high, and if we lose that eligibility our future growth could be impaired. an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 25% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year. in addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if its default rate exceeds 40% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which default rates have been calculated by the department of education. heoa modifies the higher education act’s default rate provisions. beginning with default rate calculations for federal fiscal year 2009, the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year. the current method of calculating rates will remain in effect and will be used to determine institutional eligibility until three consecutive years of cohort default rates calculated under the new formula are available. in addition, the cohort default rate threshold of 25% will be increased to 30% for purposes of certain sanctions and requirements related to cohort default rates. heoa also requires certain default prevention action by an institution with a default rate of 30% or more. because we began only recently to enroll students who are participating in the federal student loan programs, we have no historical cohort default rate for federal fiscal year 2006 or earlier. our cohort default rate for federal fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are 0.0% and 5.2%, respectively. relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term, which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our cohort default rate. if american public university system loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs because of high student loan default rates, our students would no longer be eligible to use title iv program funds in our institution, which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   if we undergo another change in ownership and control, the department of education will place us on provisional certification, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations. department of education regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if: (1) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form 8-k with the sec disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the department of education to be a change in ownership and control under this standard. under the higher education act, an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility.   in august 2008, funds affiliated with abs capital partners reduced their beneficial ownership interest from approximately 26% to approximately 24% of our outstanding common stock by distributing to their limited partners and general partners shares of our stock. as a result of this distribution of shares, we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs. as required under department of education regulations, we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control. in connection with the department of education’s review of the change, we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation, including a letter from our regional accrediting agency, the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools, indicating that it had approved the change. on october 2, 2008, we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september 30, 2010.   during our period of provisional certification, we had to comply with any additional conditions included in our program participation agreement, which included, among other things, limitations on our operations. our program participation agreement provided that, as a provisionally certified institution, we had to apply for and receive approval by the secretary for any substantial change, including but not limited to establishment of additional locations, an increase in the level of academic offering, and addition of any non-degree or short-term training program. the department of education also had authority to review us more closely during our provisional certification. on july 2, 2010, we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december 31, 2014. future transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under department of education regulations and could cause the department to place us on provisional certification as require by the law when an institution undergoes a change in ownership and control. the conditions to provisional certification or closer review by the department of education could impact, among other things, our ability to add educational programs, acquire other schools or make other significant changes. in addition, if the department of education were to determined that we were unable to meet our responsibilities while we were provisionally certified, the department could seek to revoke our certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections than if we were fully certified. limitations on our operations could, and the loss of our certification to participate in title iv programs would, adversely affect our ability to grow our presence outside the military sector in addition to having adverse effects on our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.     46     if regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to operate could be impaired.   if we or american public university system experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies, the department of education, detc, the higher learning commission, or other regulators, we must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency. a change of control occurred in august 2008 and we have completed the required notification and approval processes. as a result of its review and approval of the change, the higher learning commission conducted a focused evaluation in february 2009 as its policies require it to do as a result of a change of the type we experienced in august 2008. in june 2009 the higher learning commission confirmed approval of the change of control that occurred in august 2008. transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution’s common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution’s board of directors. some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the west virginia higher education policy commission, the state council of higher education for virginia, the department of education, detc or the higher learning commission could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require us to suspend our activities in that state or otherwise impair our operations. the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. in addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares.   risks related to owning our common stock   the price of our common stock may be volatile, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.   we completed our initial public offering in november 2007. for a significant portion of the time since our initial public offering, we have had relatively limited public float, and trading in our common stock has also been limited and, at times, volatile. an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.   the price of the common stock may fluctuate as a result of:     ● price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;       ● significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;       ● actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, enrollments or net course registrations, or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;       ● the actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in government policies, laws and regulations, or similar changes made by accrediting bodies;       ● the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;       ● general economic conditions and trends;       ● catastrophic events;       ● sales of large blocks of our stock; or       ● recruitment or departure of key personnel.   in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business.   seasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year. our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in enrollment. student population varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations and student attrition. while our number of enrolled students has grown in each sequential quarter over the past three years, the number of enrolled students has been proportionally greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year. a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. such patterns may change, however, as a result of new program introductions and increased enrollments of students. these fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations and/or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.     47     if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.   the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. if one or more of the analysts covering us downgrade their estimates or evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.   provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.   provisions in our charter and bylaws and in the delaware general corporation law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. these provisions include:     ● the ability of our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval, which may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company;       ● a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of their intention to nominate a director or to propose any other business at an annual meeting of stockholders;       ● a prohibition against stockholder action by means of written consent unless otherwise approved by our board of directors in advance; and       ● the application of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner.
