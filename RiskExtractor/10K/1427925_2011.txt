item 1a. risk factors before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this form 10-k. we believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this form 10-k. if any of the following risks comes to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our financial condition and need for additional capital we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. we are a development stage company with limited operating history. to date, we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate, the sufentanil nanotab pca system, or arx-01. we have two additional product candidates, the sufentanil nanotab btp management system, or arx-02, and the sufentanil/triazolam nanotab, or arx-03. we have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception in july 2005, including net losses of approximately $14.3 million, $20.1 million and $20.7 million during the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. as of december 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of $68.6 million. we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. to date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt. the size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. to date, none of our product candidates have been commercialized, and if our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the united states, our revenues are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the united states, as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success. we expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we expand our research and development activities and advance our clinical programs. we also expect an increase in our expenses associated with preparing for the potential commercialization of arx-01 and creating additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company. as a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. we have never generated any revenue and may never be profitable. our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates. we do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if ever. our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:        completing the clinical development of arx-01, initially for the treatment of post-operative pain in the hospital setting;        obtaining regulatory approval for arx-01;        launching and commercializing arx-01, including building a hospital-directed sales force and collaborating with third parties; and        completing the clinical development, obtaining regulatory approval, launching and commercializing arx-02 and arx-03, which will require additional funding.   33 table of contents because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. in addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the fda to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. we have a limited operating history which may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects. we were incorporated in 2005. since inception, our operations have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. we have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability or evaluation of our business and prospects may not be accurate. if we fail to obtain additional financing, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs. developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. we expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our clinical programs. as of december 31, 2010, we had negative working capital of approximately $7.6 million. although we raised $35.6 million in net proceeds in our initial public offering, or ipo, we will need to raise substantial additional funds to support our future operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds of $35.6 million from our ipo in february 2011, and the interest earned thereon, will be sufficient to fund our current operations through the second quarter of 2012. however, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. for example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expected. we will need to raise additional funding or otherwise enter into collaborations to complete the third arx-01 phase 3 clinical trial required to file our nda and, if we choose, to initiate clinical trials for our product candidates other than arx-01. in any event, we will require substantial additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. raising funds in the current economic environment, when the capital markets have been affected by the global recession, may present additional challenges. securing additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. in addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:        significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates;        seek corporate partners for arx-01 at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or        relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.   34 table of contents if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, including completing the third arx-01 phase 3 clinical trial required to file our nda, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. we may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business. in order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or debt securities, which would result in dilution to all of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business. the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and dilution to all of our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. if we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. risks related to clinical development and regulatory approval we depend substantially on the success of our product candidate, arx-01, which is still under clinical development, and may not obtain regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized. we have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize arx-01, which has completed phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of post-operative pain. we expect to initiate one of the three planned phase 3 clinical trials for arx-01 in the second half of 2011 with a second phase 3 initiating in early 2012. contingent on our ability to secure additional funding, we plan to begin a third phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2012. we intend to use these trials as a basis to submit an nda for arx-01. there is no guarantee that our phase 3 clinical trials will be completed, or if completed, will be successful. any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing arx-01, generating revenues and achieving profitability. if any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for arx-01, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. we depend substantially on the successful completion of phase 3 clinical trials for our product candidates. the positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in phase 2 clinical studies may not be repeated in phase 3. we have completed phase 2 clinical studies and participated in an end of phase 2 meeting for each of our three product candidates. however, we have never conducted a phase 3 clinical trial. our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical and medical device development. before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must successfully complete phase 3 clinical trials. negative or inconclusive results of a phase 3 clinical study could cause the fda to require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies. furthermore, while we have obtained positive safety and efficacy results for our sufentanil-based product candidates during our prior clinical trials, we cannot be certain that these results will be duplicated when our product candidates are tested in a larger number of patients in our phase 3 clinical trials.   35 table of contents delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales. we may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. we expect to initiate one of the three planned phase 3 clinical trials of arx-01 in the second half of 2011 with a second phase 3 study being initiated in early 2012. our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:        inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial, including the inability to secure additional funding to complete the third arx-01 phase 3 clinical trial required to file our nda;        delays in pharmacokinetic studies required prior to phase 3 initiation;        delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;        delays in reaching agreement with the fda on final trial design;        imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities;        delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or cros, and clinical trial sites;        delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;        delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;        delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the device components of our product candidates;        delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;        clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;        time required to add new clinical sites; or        delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials. if initiation or completion of the phase 3 trials are delayed for our product candidates for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize and commence sales of our product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. our product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance. adverse events, or aes, caused by our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with our product candidates have generated some aes, but no serious adverse events, or saes. for example, in arx-01 clinical studies completed to date, 11% of the patients experienced vomiting and 8% experienced itching for 10 mcg and 15 mcg treated groups, as compared to the placebo treated subjects, of which 6% experienced vomiting and none experienced itching. if saes are observed in any of our clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted. further, if our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:        regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or rems;   36 table of contents      regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;        we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;        we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or        our reputation may suffer. any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates. additional time may be required to obtain regulatory approval for our arx-01 product candidate because it is a drug/device combination. arx-01 is a drug/device combination. we have filed an ind for arx-01. based on our discussions with the fda, we believe that arx-01 will be reviewed as a combination product, with both drug and device components submitted in the ind, and both components will eventually be part of an nda. there are very few examples of the fda approval process for drug/device combination products such as arx-01. as a result, we may experience delays in regulatory approval for arx-01 due to uncertainties in the approval process, in particular as it relates to device approval under an nda. after the completion of our clinical trials, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize arx-01 and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from arx-01. we cannot commercialize arx-01 until the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the fda, have reviewed and approved the product candidate. the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for arx-01. additional delays may result if arx-01 is taken before an fda advisory committee which may recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non-approval. in addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. even if we obtain regulatory approval for arx-01 and our other product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties. even if we obtain regulatory approval in the united states, the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. for example, the labeling ultimately approved for arx-01 and our other product candidates will likely include restrictions on use due to the opiate nature of sufentanil. arx-01 and our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing fda requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. the holder of an approved nda is obligated to monitor and report aes and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the nda. the holder of an approved nda must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. in addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cgmp, and adherence to commitments made in the nda. if we, or a regulatory   37 table of contents agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as aes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidate, a regulatory agency may:        issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;        seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;        suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;        suspend any ongoing clinical trials;        refuse to approve a pending nda or supplements to an nda submitted by us;        seize product; or        refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues. even if we obtain fda approval for arx-01 in the united states, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our products outside of the united states, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. in order to market any products outside of the united states, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed. arx-01 and our other product candidates will require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. the fda amendments act of 2007 implemented safety-related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of rems. our product candidates will require rems. the rems may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals and restrictions on distribution and use. while we have received information from the fda regarding certain aspects of the required rems for arx-01, we cannot predict the specific rems to be required as part of the fdas approval of arx-01. depending on the extent of the rems requirements, our costs to commercialize arx-01 may increase significantly. arx-02 and arx-03, if approved, will also require rems programs that may increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates. furthermore, risks of sufentanil that are not adequately addressed through proposed rems for our product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization.   38 table of contents risks related to our reliance on third parties we rely on third party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates. reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the pharmaceutical, device and drug cartridge aspects of our product candidates ourselves, including:        the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;        a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;        manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;        costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;        a failure to comply with cgmp and similar foreign standards;        the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;        termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;        the reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;        the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;        operations of our third party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;        carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and        the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner. any of these events could lead to clinical study delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products. some of these events could be the basis for fda action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production. we rely on limited sources of supply for the drug component of our product candidates and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing our product candidates. currently we use two established suppliers of sufentanil citrate for our nanotabs, covidien plc and johnson matthey plc. for each product candidate, only one of the two suppliers will be qualified as a vendor with the fda. if supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. the alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an nda supplement which could result in further delay. the fda or other regulatory agencies outside of the united states may also require additional studies if a new sufentanil supplier is relied upon for commercial production. in addition, the drug enforcement administration, or the dea, may reduce, delay or refuse our quota for sufentanil, which would disrupt our supply of sufentanil citrate and cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. currently, we use one supplier of triazolam for our arx-03 nanotabs. switching triazolam suppliers may involve substantial cost and is a likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. these factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing   39 table of contents them successfully. furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue. manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs requires specialized equipment and expertise. ethanol, which is used in the manufacturing process, is flammable, which necessitates the use of specialized equipment and facilities for manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs. there are a limited number of facilities that can accommodate our manufacturing process and we need to use dedicated equipment throughout development and commercial manufacturing to avoid the possibility of cross-contamination. if our equipment breaks down or needs to be repaired or replaced, it may cause significant disruption in clinical or commercial supply, which could result in delay in the process of obtaining approval for or sale of our products. furthermore, we are using one facility to manufacture our sufentanil nanotabs and have not identified a back up facility to date. any problems with our existing facility or equipment may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates and increase our cost. manufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization. as we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. in the past we have identified impurities in the drug substance or excipients that comprise the sufentanil or sufentanil/triazolam nanotab products. in the future we may identify significant impurities, which could result in increased scrutiny by the regulatory agencies, delays in clinical program and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products. our designs for the device components of our product candidates for phase 3 clinical trials may not be fully functional or commercially viable. the arx-01 device we plan to use in phase 3 clinical trials and commercially, or phase 3 device, has more features than the device used in phase 2, including additional software and functionality. although we have conducted multiple human factor and usability studies, the design of the arx-01 phase 3 device is still under development. we plan to complete an additional user testing study prior to release of the device for phase 3 clinical trials. however, we cannot predict if the phase 3 device will be fully functional or acceptable for commercial use. if we need to modify the phase 3 device after the completion of the phase 3 studies, we may incur higher costs and experience delay in regulatory approval and commercialization of arx-01. furthermore, if the changes to the device are substantial, we may need to conduct further clinical studies in order to have the commercial device approved by the fda. the dispensing components of arx-02 and arx-03 are still under development. we cannot be certain that the dispensing components of arx-02 and arx-03 will be fully functional or acceptable for commercial use or that we will be able to effectively scale up the manufacturing process. failure to do so may delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization of arx-02 and arx-03. we have no experience manufacturing the arx-01 phase 3 device on a clinical or commercial scale and do not own or operate a manufacturing facility. we have relied on contract manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers to produce arx-01 devices for phase 2 clinical trials. we currently outsource manufacturing and packaging of the controller, dispenser and cartridge components of the arx-01 device to third parties and intend to continue to do so. we may encounter unanticipated problems in the scale-up and automation process that will result in delays in the manufacturing of the arx-01 cartridge, dispenser or controller.   40 table of contents we do not currently have any agreements with third party manufacturers for the manufacture of the phase 3 device. we may not be able to enter into agreements for commercial supply of arx-01 with third party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. we may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for device manufacture. such suppliers are subject to fda regulations requiring that materials be produced under cgmps, or quality system regulations, or qsr, and subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies. failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements. reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control; and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities. we rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business. we rely on clinical research organizations, or cros, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. we have relied and plan to continue to rely upon cros to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for arx-01 and our other product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. we control only certain aspects of our cros activities. nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. since our drug products are controlled substances, all of our contract manufacturing organizations, or cmos, and cros must follow proper dea rules and procedures or comparable rules and procedures in other countries. failure to properly follow these rules and procedures could result in dea action, up to and including losing their license to work with controlled substances. this would result in a major delay in our clinical studies and/or nda submission. we and our cros are required to comply with the fdas current good clinical practices, or cgcps, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda for all of our product candidates in clinical development. the fda enforces these cgcps through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable cgcps, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. upon inspection, the fda may determine that our phase 3 clinical trials do not comply with cgcps. in addition, our phase 3 clinical trials will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of arx-01. accordingly, if our cros fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat the phase 3 clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. our cros are not our employees, and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs. these cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position. we face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by cros, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory   41 table of contents approval for, or successfully commercialize arx-01, or our other product candidates. as a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for arx-01 and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. risks related to commercialization of our product candidates the commercial success of arx-01 and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. the degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:        demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;        the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors;        the prevalence and severity of any aes;        overcoming the perception of sufentanil as a potentially unsafe drug due to its high potency;        limitations or warnings contained in the fda-approved label for arx-01;        availability of alternative treatments;        pricing and cost-effectiveness;        the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators sales and marketing strategies;        our ability to obtain hospital formulary approval;        our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement; and        the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third party coverage. if arx-01 is approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue from arx-01 and we may not become or remain profitable. if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue. we currently do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. in order to market any products that may be approved, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. we intend to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the united states. we will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates in the united states. to date, we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any of our product candidates. we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. we may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships. our strategy for arx-01 is to develop a hospital-directed sales force and/or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third party payors in the united states. our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. if we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical   42 table of contents regions, including the united states, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected. if we are unable to negotiate a strategic partnership or obtain additional financial resources for arx-02 or arx-03, we may be forced to curtail the development of arx-02 or arx-03, delay potential commercialization, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. in addition, without a partnership, we will bear all the risk related to the development of arx-02 or arx-03. if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. if we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring arx-02 or arx-03 to market or generate product revenue. if we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies. if we obtain approval to commercialize our products outside of the united states, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business. if our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market arx-01 outside the united states. we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:        different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;        reduced protection for intellectual property rights;        unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;        economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;        compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;        foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;        foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;        workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states;        production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and        business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires. if we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may not reach their commercial potential. the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. if our product candidates obtain fda approval, they will compete with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed, manufactured and marketed by others. we will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.   43 table of contents the primary competition for arx-01 is the iv pca pump, which is widely used in the post-operative setting. leading manufacturers of iv pca pumps include hospira inc., carefusion corporation, baxter international inc., curlin medical, inc. and smiths medical. the most common opioids used to treat post-operative pain are morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, all of which are available as generics. also available on the market is the avancen medication on demand, or mod, oral pca device developed by avancen mod corporation. additional potential competitors for arx-01 include products in development, including the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, ionsys, originally developed by alza corporation and ortho-mcneil pharmaceutical, inc., both johnson & johnson subsidiaries, and currently under development by incline therapeutics, inc.; and rylomine, an intranasal morphine product developed by javelin pharmaceuticals, inc. our potential competitors for arx-02 include products approved in the united states for cancer breakthrough pain, including: actiq and fentora, currently manufactured by cephalon inc.; onsolis, currently manufactured by biodelivery sciences international, inc.; and abstral, currently manufactured by prostrakan group plc; as well as products approved in europe, including: instanyl, currently manufactured by nycomed international management gmbh. the active ingredient in all approved products for cancer breakthrough pain is fentanyl. additional potential competitors for arx-02 include products in late stage development for cancer breakthrough pain, such as: pecfent, currently manufactured by archimedes pharma limited; fentanyl taifun, currently manufactured by akela pharma, inc.; and sl spray, currently manufactured by insys therapeutics, inc. it is possible that any of these competitors could develop or improve technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential. key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining fda and other regulatory approval of products and the commercialization of those products. accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. our competitors drugs or drug delivery systems may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture, or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize. this may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover our losses. we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available. these entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors, which may adversely affect our competitive position. finally, the development of different methods for the treatment of post-operative pain or breakthrough pain could render arx-01 and arx-02, respectively, non-competitive or obsolete. these and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations. hospital formulary approval and reimbursement may not be available for arx-01 and our other product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably. obtaining formulary approval can be an expensive and time consuming process. we cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell our products into our target markets. failure to obtain timely formulary approval will limit our commercial success. furthermore, market acceptance and sales of arx-01, or any future product candidates that we develop, will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. we cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for arx-01, or any future product candidates. also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. if reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize arx-01, or any future product candidates that we develop.   44 table of contents there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. these legislative and/or regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for our products, following approval. the availability of numerous generic pain medications may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for arx-01. the potential application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite the approval of additional pain medication generic drugs. we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of arx-01 and any other products that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. if we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed. risks related to our business operations and industry failure to comply with the drug enforcement administration regulations, or the cost of compliance with these regulations, may adversely affect our business. our sufentanil-based products are subject to extensive regulation by the dea, due to their status as scheduled drugs. sufentanil is a schedule ii opioid, considered to present the highest risk of abuse. the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances are subject to a high degree of regulation, including security, record-keeping and reporting obligations enforced by the dea. this high degree of regulation can result in significant costs in order to comply with the required regulations, which may have an adverse effect on the development and commercialization of our product candidates. the dea limits the availability and production of all schedule ii substances, including sufentanil, through a quota system. the dea requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas to manufacturers. at present, our contract manufacturers have applied for a quota on our behalf which allocates a sufficient quantity of sufentanil to meet our planned clinical and pre-clinical needs during 2011. in future years, we may need greater amounts of sufentanil to sustain and complete our phase 3 development program for arx-01, and we will need significantly greater amounts of sufentanil to implement our commercialization plans if the fda approves arx-01. any delay or refusal by the dea in establishing the procurement quota or a reduction in our quota for sufentanil or a failure to increase it over time as we anticipate could delay or stop the clinical development or commercial sale of arx-01. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. in addition, we purchase sufentanil in the united states and ship it to our third party manufacturer, patheon inc. in toronto, canada, where much of our clinical trial manufacturing has been completed to date. shipping across international borders is a bureaucratic process that takes a minimum of three months and requires permits to export drug out of the united states and import nanotabs into the united states. if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fail to submit permit applications in a timely manner, the government could refuse to permit sufentanil to be exported from or imported into the united states. our failure to comply with these requirements could result in increased costs, delayed shipments, the loss of dea registration for one of our suppliers, significant restrictions on arx-01, civil penalties or criminal prosecution and delays in conducting our clinical trials. drug enforcement administration regulations require that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if sufentanil-based products are to be marketed in the united states, and there is no guarantee that we will secure a commercial supply agreement with a manufacturer based in the united states. a substantial portion of our clinical trial manufacturing to date has been completed at patheon inc. in toronto, canada. however, we cannot rely on the patheon facility located in toronto for commercial manufacturing of sufentanil because the dea requires that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if our product candidates are marketed in the united states.   45 table of contents we have identified potential commercial manufacturers for arx-01 in the united states. however, we do not yet have a commercial supply contract in place. if we cannot establish a supply contract on commercially reasonable terms, or if facility modifications, equipment manufacture or modification do not meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. switching or adding commercial manufacturing capability can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus, as well as additional regulatory filings. in addition, there is a natural transition period when a new manufacturing facility commences work. as a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired commercial timelines, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our ability to generate revenue. the facilities of any of our future manufacturers of sufentanil-containing nanotabs must be approved by the fda after we submit our nda and before approval of arx-01 and our other product candidates. we do not control the manufacturing process of sufentanil nanotabs and are completely dependent on these third party manufacturing partners for compliance with the fdas requirements for manufacture. in addition, although our third party manufacturers are well established commercial manufacturers, we are dependent on their continued adherence to cgmp manufacturing and acceptable changes to their process. if our manufacturers cannot successfully produce material that conforms to our specifications and the fdas strict regulatory requirements, they will not be able to secure fda approval for their manufacturing facilities. if the fda does not approve these facilities for the commercial manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs, we will need to find alternative suppliers, which would result in significant delays in obtaining fda approval for arx-01. these challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales. our headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area, near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. we are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations. we do not carry insurance for earthquakes or other natural disasters and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. we are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team listed under item 10. directors, executive officers and corporate governanceexecutive officers of the registrant appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. while we have entered into offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are at will employees. recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. there is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. as a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. in addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. the inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. we will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. as of december 31, 2010, we had 19 full-time employees. as our company matures, we expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific and engineering, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. future growth would impose significant additional   46 table of contents responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize arx-01 and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. we face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability. the use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. in addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:        impairment of our business reputation;        withdrawal of clinical study participants;        costs due to related litigation;        distraction of managements attention from our primary business;        substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;        the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and        decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. if and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. on occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. risks related to our intellectual property we have numerous pending patent applications in the united states, but no issued patents. our only patent, which is issued in europe, is currently in the opposition period. if our pending patent applications fail to issue or if our issued european patent is successfully opposed, our business will be adversely affected. our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third party challenges. to protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patents as well as other intellectual property protections, including trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality provisions.   47 table of contents in addition, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. as of december 31, 2010, we are the owner of record and are pursuing 15 u.s. non-provisional patent applications, three pending international patent cooperation treaty applications and 39 foreign national and ten european regional counterpart patent applications directed to our product candidates. the patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the united states or in foreign countries. even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents. our european patent, though granted, may be opposed by third parties during a nine-month opposition period that ends on april 21, 2011. if a third party opposes our european patent, we will need to spend considerable time and resources to defend our granted patent claims. european opposition proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management. the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies, including us, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states. legal developments may preclude or limit the scope of available patent protection. litigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. if we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business. our commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. as we enter our markets, it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and/or processes infringe their intellectual property rights. these third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to, or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology, allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents. in a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. the strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. however, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. in the united states, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. if we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology. if we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. for example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. if we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. in addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products. it is possible that we may in the future receive, particularly as a public company, communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other   48 table of contents intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. in addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. we may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to successful in our defense. our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established. it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states. the pharmaceutical patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain. changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties. further, if any patents license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology. the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:        we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;        we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;        others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;        any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or        the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business. if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability. we may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. however, trade secrets are difficult to protect. we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. in addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position. periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the united states patent and trademark office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. we have systems in place to remind us to pay periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees, and we employ an outside firm, mcdonnell boehnen hulbert berghoff llp, or mbhb, in chicago, illinois, to pay these fees. the united states patent and trademark office, or the uspto,   49 table of contents and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. we employ mbhb and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. however, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. if this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world. the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. for example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. in addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the united states and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. we have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. we have registered our acelrx mark in class 5, pharmaceutical preparations for treating pain; pharmaceutical preparations for treating anxiety, and class 10, drug delivery systems; medical device, namely, a mechanical and electronic device used to administer medications, perform timed medication delivery, and to provide secure access to and delivery of medications, in the united states. our acelrx mark has also been registered in the european community and in canada, and is pending in india. we have filed a trademark application for our nanotab mark and our tagline, accelerate, innovate, alleviate in class 5, in the united states. although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications, it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered. the registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. it is also possible that we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and that there are names or symbols other than acelrx that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. prior to our ipo in february 2011, there was no public market for our common stock. an active public trading market may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. moreover, the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:        adverse results or delays in clinical trials;        inability to obtain additional funding, including funding necessary to complete the third arx-01 phase 3 clinical trial required to file our nda;   50 table of contents      any delay in filing an nda for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the fdas review of that nda;        failure to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates;        changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;        inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;        adverse regulatory decisions;        introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;        failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;        failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;        the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;        announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;        disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;        additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;        significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;        changes in the market valuations of similar companies;        sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and        trading volume of our common stock. in addition, the stock market in general, and the nasdaq global market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. our executive officers and directors, together with the stockholders with whom our executive officers and directors are affiliated or associated, beneficially owned approximately 78% of our outstanding voting stock as of march 1, 2011. therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. these stockholders are able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. for example, these stockholders, acting together, are able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. we incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. in addition, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as amended, or the sarbanes-oxley act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission, or sec, and the nasdaq stock market have imposed various   51 table of contents requirements on public companies. our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. for example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. as a public company, we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. if we are unable to comply with section 404 in a timely manner, it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting. assessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. we plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify. in addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ending december 31, 2012, unless we qualify for an exemption as a non-accelerated filer under the applicable sec rules and regulations. we have been and will continue to be involved in a substantial effort to implement appropriate processes, document the system of internal control over key processes, assess their design, remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation. we cannot be certain at this time whether our measures to improve internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of section 404 or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404, it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and negatively impact the quality of disclosure to our investors. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify and report a material weakness, it could adversely affect our stock price. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. as of march 1, 2011, we had 19,371,750 shares of common stock outstanding. substantially all of our stockholders that held stock prior to our ipo are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our ipo that restrict the stockholders ability to transfer shares of our common stock until at least august 10, 2011. the lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold until the expiration of the lock-up period. upon the expiration of the lock-up period, approximately 16,171,750 of the shares outstanding as of march 1, 2011 will become eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act. the remaining 3,200,000 shares of common stock outstanding as of march 1, 2011 are freely tradable without restriction or further registration. in addition, shares issued or issuable upon exercise of options and warrants vested as of the expiration of the lock-up period will be eligible for sale at that time. sales of stock by our existing stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities act, subject to the lock-up arrangement described above. registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act. any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.   52 table of contents future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. we expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. if we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. these sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. pursuant to our 2011 equity incentive plan, or the 2011 incentive plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. the number of shares available for future grant under our 2011 incentive plan will automatically increase each year by 4% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of december 31 of the prior calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under our 2011 incentive plan each year. if our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by the maximum amount each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. we are at risk of securities class action litigation. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. this risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. if we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which could harm our business. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporations ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset united states federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.   53 table of contents provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management. some provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. these provisions include:        authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;        limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;        creating a staggered board of directors;        prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;        eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and        establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. in addition, we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. further, other provisions of delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us. item 1b. unresolved
