item 1a.   risk factors   this section highlights specific risks that could affect our company and its businesses. you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k. based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company. however, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.   if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.   current economic and political risks   difficult conditions in the global capital markets and economy generally, as well as political conditions in the united states and elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.   our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the united states and elsewhere around the world. 73 table of contents ongoing concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the mortgage and real estate markets, sovereign debt crises, fear of a double-dip recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. these factors, combined with still relatively low levels of consumer confidence and relatively high levels of unemployment, continue to impact global economies. this environment has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are very dependent upon consumer and business behavior. if the economy were to worsen, customer behaviors could change further. for example, cardmembers could decide to redeem membership rewards points at abnormally high levels to replace cash expenditures.   factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, interest rates, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending is likely to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, the factors discussed above may cause our earnings, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, and may impact the trading price of our common shares.   political or economic instability in certain regions or countries could also affect our commercial or other lending activities, among other businesses, or result in restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies. in addition, our travel network may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and other conditions. travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns.   terrorist attacks, intrusion into our infrastructure by hackers or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on our business. because of our proximity to the world trade center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001. similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus is likely to decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues or when travel might involve health-related risks.   we held approximately $5.8 billion of investment securities of state and municipal obligations as of december 31, 2010. in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio.   if the conditions described above (or similar ones) were to persist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.   adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.   the global money and capital markets, while demonstrating generally improved conditions, remain susceptible to volatility and disruption, which could negatively impact market liquidity conditions.   we need liquidity to pay merchants, operating expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to limit our investments in growth opportunities or curtail operations. the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from cardmembers and merchants, cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash, direct and third-party distributed deposits, debt instruments such as unsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations, securitized borrowings through our conduit facility, the federal reserve discount window and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain countries outside the united states.   notwithstanding our solid financial position, we are not immune from pressures experienced broadly across the financial markets. the fragility of the credit markets and the current economic and regulatory 74 table of contents environment have impacted financial services companies. although the market for our unsecured term debt and asset securitizations has improved, there is no assurance that the markets will be open to us in the future. therefore, our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand. in addition, our liquidity position will be impacted by our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the maintenance and growth of our direct and third-party distributed deposit programs. we also would have less flexibility in accessing the commercial paper market as a short-term funding vehicle in the event of a downgrade in credcos short-term debt rating and volatility in the commercial paper market generally.   in the event that current sources of liquidity, including internal sources, do not satisfy our needs, we would be required to seek additional financing. the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit and consumer deposits, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings (which were downgraded in april 2009 by two of the major ratings agencies), and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders or depositors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to an economic downturn.   similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. while we have experienced positive credit trends since the latter half of 2009, if the performance of our charge card and credit card portfolios were to weaken through increasing delinquencies and write-offs, our long-term and short-term debt ratings could be downgraded and our access to capital could be materially adversely affected and our cost of capital could increase. disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to grow our business. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. if levels of market disruption and volatility worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see financial review  funding programs and activities on pages 42-46 of our 2010 annual report to shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.   we can be adversely affected by the impairment of other financial institutions.   our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. defaults or non-performance by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of our counterparties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   any reduction in the companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   although the companys and its subsidiaries long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt were downgraded during the second quarter of 2009 by moodys investors services (moodys) and standard & poors (s&p), two of the major rating agencies. the rating agencies regularly evaluate the company and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of the companys and its subsidiaries long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including their financial strength as well as factors not entirely within their control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry 75 table of contents generally, and the wider state of the economy. there can be no assurance that the company and its subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. failure to maintain those ratings could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company and its subsidiaries are able to obtain funding.   the ability of issuers of asset-backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically been based, in part, on qualification under the fdics safe harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations. in 2009 and 2010, the fdic issued a series of changes to its safe harbor rule, with its new final rule for its securitization safe harbor, issued in 2010, requiring issuers to comply with a new set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor. issuances out of our american express credit account master trust are grandfathered under the new fdic final rule. the trust for the companys cardmember charge receivable securitization (the charge trust) does not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the fdics new safe harbor rule, nor did it meet the requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing prior to 2009. it was structured and continues to be structured such that the financial assets transferred to the charge trust would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in the event the fdic is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the originating banks. the company has received confirmation from moodys, s&p and fitch ratings, which rate issuances from the charge trust, that they will continue to rate issuances from the charge trust in the same manner as they have historically, even though they do not satisfy the requirements to be covered by the fdics safe harbor rule. nevertheless, one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule, the highest rating a charge trust security could receive would be based on the originating banks unsecured debt rating. if one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion, it could adversely impact the companys capacity and cost of using its charge trust as a source of funding for its business.   we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take. as with other companies in the financial services industry, the companys and its subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies.   adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations.   during 2010, over 33% of our revenue net of interest expense was generated from activities outside the united states. we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the u.s. dollar. resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into u.s. dollars. the occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could decrease the revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   legal and regulatory risks   ongoing legal proceedings regarding the companys anti-steering and surcharging-related contractual provisions could require changes to those provisions that could result in a material loss of revenue or increased expenses, substantial monetary judgments and/or damage to the companys global reputation and brand.   the doj and certain state attorneys general have recently brought an action against the company alleging that the provisions in the companys card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the companys card products at the point of sale violate the u.s. antitrust laws. visa and mastercard are also defendants in this proceeding, but they have entered into a proposed settlement, which is subject to judicial review and approval following a comment period. in addition, the company is a defendant in a number of actions, including proposed class actions, filed by merchants that challenge the companys anti-steering provisions as well as surcharging-related provisions. visa and mastercard have been named as defendants in lawsuits that include similar allegations relating to their anti-steering and/or 76 table of contents surcharging-related policies and rules. a description of these legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings below. an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings against the company could materially and adversely impact the profitability of the company, require it to change its merchant agreements in a way that could expose the companys card products to steering or other forms of discrimination at the point of sale that would impair our cardmembers experience, result in the imposition of substantial monetary damages and/or damage the companys global reputation and brand. even if the company were not required to change its merchant agreements, changes in visa and mastercards policies or practices as a result of any such legal proceedings or regulatory actions could subject the company to market pressures that could materially and adversely impact its profitability.   the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   in july 2010, president obama signed into law dodd-frank. dodd-frank, as well as regulations promulgated thereunder, could have a significant adverse impact on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition by, for example, requiring the company to change its business practices, requiring the company to comply with more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, limiting the companys ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on the company (including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of asset-backed securities), limiting the fees the company can charge for services and impacting the value of the companys assets. a description of certain provisions of dodd-frank and other legislative and regulatory developments is contained in supervision and regulation above.   dodd-frank will result in increased scrutiny and oversight of consumer financial services and products, primarily through the establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau within the federal reserve. the bureau will have broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. the bureau will write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, and enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions like us, centurion bank and aebfsb for compliance. the bureau will collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. depending on how the bureau functions and its areas of focus, it could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. in addition to increasing our compliance costs and potentially delaying our ability to respond to marketplace changes, this could result in requirements to alter our products and services that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably. the impact this new regulatory regime will have on the companys business is uncertain at this time and will depend on, among other things, the timing of the bureaus assumption of its authority from other governmental agencies, which is expected to occur by july 21, 2011.   under dodd-frank, the federal reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use prepaid card, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions. additionally, dodd-frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that such offers do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer. further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. dodd-frank also permits u.s. merchants to establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not discriminate between networks or issuers. federal government agencies and institutions of higher learning also are permitted to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. for more information on this aspect of dodd-frank and its potential impact on our business, please see risk factors-banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing global regulatory 77 table of contents focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our network.   dodd-frank mandates the federal reserve to establish heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, living wills and stress tests for, among others, bank holding companies that have greater than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the company. in addition, most interest rate and currency swaps will be required to be exchange-traded which may increase collateral posting requirements for the company.   pursuant to dodd-frank, the responsibility and authority of the ots to supervise federal savings associations, including aebfsb, will be transferred to the occ on july 21, 2011 (unless extended for up to six months). aebfsb will need to develop a relationship with its new regulator, and there could be additional compliance costs associated with aligning aebfsbs current compliance structure with the occs expectations. additionally, the transfer of responsibility from the ots to the occ could result in new regulatory standards as it is, at this time, unclear whether the occ will adopt or modify ots regulations, orders or policies, including interpretations or applications. any shifts in current regulatory positions could adversely affect our results of operation.   many provisions of dodd-frank, including numerous provisions not described above, require the adoption of rules to implement. in addition, dodd-frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. therefore, the ultimate consequences of dodd-frank and its implementing regulations on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.   the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 will significantly impact our business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   the card act required the company to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. among other things, the card act prohibits an issuer from increasing the apr on outstanding balances (with limited exceptions), requires additional account disclosures, provides consumers with the right to opt out of significant changes to account terms, and restricts penalty fees and charges that may be imposed by an issuer. most of the requirements of the card act became effective in february 2010. additional amendments to regulation z revising the open-end credit disclosure requirements became effective on july 1, 2010.   since august 22, 2010, the card act, among other things, requires that penalty fees be reasonable and proportional. also, since august 22, 2010, the card act requires issuers to periodically reevaluate apr increases to determine if a decrease is appropriate. the first of these reevaluations must be completed in february 2011. the obligation to periodically reevaluate apr increases is ongoing, and it is uncertain how these provisions will be interpreted or amended by the new consumer financial protection bureau. therefore, while the ultimate impact of this requirement is uncertain at this time, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations.   while the company has made certain changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact of the changes required by the card act, there is no assurance that it will be successful. the long-term impact of the card act on the companys business practices and revenues will depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business strategies, consumer behavior and the actions of the companys competitors, which are difficult to predict at this time. in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective, they could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, including its revenue and net income. 78 table of contents our business is subject to significant and extensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   on november 14, 2008, american express company and trs each became bank holding companies under the bhc act and elected to be treated as financial holding companies under the bhc act. as a result of becoming a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the federal reserve, including, without limitation, consolidated capital regulation at the holding company level, maintenance of certain capital and management standards in connection with our two u.s. depository institutions and restrictions on our non-banking activities under the federal reserves regulations.   if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements applicable to bank holding companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.   we are also subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, both as a participant in the financial services industry and otherwise. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our shareholders or creditors. among other things, as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and regulations, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities, subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees. there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses may be imposed which could impact the profitability of the companys business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require the company to change certain of its business practices or alter its relationships with customers, affect retention of key company personnel, or expose the company to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   please see supervision and regulation beginning on page 38 for more information about the regulation to which we are subject.   we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected.   under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, the company, trs and our subsidiary banks, centurion bank and aebfsb, must meet guidelines for capital adequacy and leverage ratios that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. as discussed above under supervision and regulation  capital adequacy, the capital requirements applicable to the company and trs as bank holding companies and our subsidiary depository institutions are in the process of being substantially revised, including in connection with our transition to basel ii and as a result of basel iii and the requirements of dodd-frank. if the company, trs or our subsidiary depository institutions fail to meet current or future minimum capital, leverage or other financial requirements, their respective financial conditions would be materially adversely affected. in light of recent market events, dodd-frank and basel iii, the company, trs and our subsidiary depository institutions will be required to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past. we cannot fully predict the final form of, or the effects of, these regulations. failure by any of the company, trs or a subsidiary depository institution to maintain its respective status as well capitalized and well managed, if unremedied over a period of time, would cause us to lose our status as a financial holding company and could compromise our competitive position. for more information on capital adequacy requirements, please see supervision and regulation  capital adequacy above. 79 table of contents we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock.   we are limited in our ability to pay dividends by our regulators who could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. for example, it is the policy of the federal reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs, asset quality, and financial condition. recently issued temporary guidance from the federal reserve states that our dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve basel iii capital ratio requirements. a company that has not achieved basel iii capital requirements on a fully phased-in basis may have difficulty increasing dividends.   while the regulations ultimately applicable to the company will be determined by the federal reserve, the company estimates that, had regulations implementing basel iii been in place during the fourth quarter of 2010, the companys capital ratios under basel iii would have exceeded the minimum requirements. this estimate could change in the future. while we expect to meet the basel iii capital requirements, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, as phased in by the federal reserve, the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially different from the basel iii final framework as published in december 2010. moreover, the federal reserve will closely scrutinize any dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income.   during the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program. on january 7, 2011, we submitted our comprehensive capital plan (ccp) to the federal reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share repurchases in 2011. the ccp includes an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions. we expect a response from the federal reserve by the end of the first quarter. no additional shares are expected to be repurchased prior to its response. we cannot predict whether the federal reserve will approve additional share purchases.   for more information on bank holding company dividend restrictions, please see supervision and regulation  general  dividends on page 46, as well as financial review  share repurchases and dividends on page 41 and note 23 on page 111 of our 2010 annual report to shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.   banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our network.   we are subject to regulations that affect banks and the payments industry in the united states and many other countries in which our charge and credit cards are used and where we conduct banking and card activities. in particular, we are subject to numerous regulations applicable to financial institutions in the united states and abroad. we are also subject to regulations as a provider of services to financial institutions. regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. for example, we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act, with regard to maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our charge and credit cards may be used, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our charge and credit cards. in addition, the member states of the european economic area have now implemented a relatively new european union legislative directive, called the payment services directive, for electronic payment services, including cards, that puts in place a common legal framework for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business.   various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards. these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could decrease 80 table of contents our transaction volumes. in some circumstances, new regulations and legislation could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge or credit cards or restricting our ability to offer existing cards, such as stored value cards, which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth.   in recent years, regulators in several countries outside the united states have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. regulators in the united kingdom, canada, new zealand, poland, italy, switzerland, hungary, the european union, australia, brazil, mexico and venezuela, among others, have conducted investigations that are either ongoing, concluded or on appeal.   the interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four party payment networks, like visa and mastercard, is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge charged to merchants for bankcard debit and credit card acceptance in these systems. by contrast, the american express network does not have interchange fees. although the regulators focus has primarily been on visa and mastercard as the dominant card networks and on their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing could ultimately affect all networks. lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs.   in the united states, congress continued to focus on the interchange issue during 2010. congress passed dodd-frank, which the president signed into law in july 2010. dodd-frank gives the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use prepaid card, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions. american express does not offer a debit card linked to a deposit account, but does issue various types of prepaid cards. reloadable general-use prepaid cards, but not those marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, are exempt from the interchange fee limitations. in contrast to the interchange fee limitations, all prepaid cards would be subject to the exclusive network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions. in december 2010, the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comments to implement the interchange fee limitations and exclusive network routing restrictions. the federal reserve must issue final rules on the exclusive network routing restrictions by july 21, 2011. the statute does not specify when those rules must take effect. it is difficult to assess at this time the extent to which the final regulations, once issued, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.   additionally, dodd-frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that such offers do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer. further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. dodd-frank also permits u.s. merchants to establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not discriminate between networks or issuers. federal government agencies and institutions of higher learning are also permitted to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. as a result of these new laws, customers may be incentivized by merchants to move away from the use of charge and credit card products to other forms of payment, such as debit, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.   during the last four years, a number of bills were proposed in individual state legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange fees or to prohibit credit card companies from charging a merchant discount on the sales tax portion of credit card purchases. other proposals were aimed at increasing the transparency of card network rules for merchants. in addition, a number of bills were proposed to establish merchant liability for the costs of a data security breach of a merchants system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to protect sensitive cardholder payment information. in 2010, vermont enacted legislation that permits merchants to set a minimum dollar value of no more than $10 for acceptance of any form of 81 table of contents payment; permits merchants to provide discounts or other benefits based on the form of payment (i.e., card, cash, check, debit card, stored-value card, charge card or credit card); and permits merchants to accept the cards of a payment system at one or more of its locations but not at others. this legislation may serve as a model for other states. in the event that additional legislative or regulatory activity to limit interchange or merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security legislation is adopted, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.   increased regulatory focus on our company, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may increase our compliance costs or result in a reduction of transactions processed on our networks or merchant discount revenues from such transactions, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.   if we are not able to protect our intellectual property, and invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.   our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. in order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in business process and technology advances across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management, customer interactions and communications, travel reservations systems, prepaid products, alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems. we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. we expect that new technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our cards, networks and other services. because of evolving payments technologies and the competitive landscape, we may not, among other things, be successful in increasing or maintaining our share of online spending and enhancing our cardmembers digital experience, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. our ability to develop, acquire, or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may be limited by patent rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. in addition, our ability to adopt new technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards or by resistance from cardmembers or merchants to such changes.   we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents and controls on access and distribution. these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. in addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation, we cannot assure you that a future assertion of an infringement claim against us will not cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant monetary damages.   regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs and decrease the number of charge and credit cards issued.   we are subject to various regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. for example, in the united states, we are subject to the safeguards guidelines under the gramm-leach-bliley act. the safeguards guidelines require that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. broad-ranging data security laws that affect our business have also been adopted by various states, such as massachusetts and nevada.   compliance with these laws regarding the protection of customer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for the company, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties 82 table of contents for non-compliance. many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are also expanding the scope of their data security requirements and standards, as well as increasing enforcement activity in this area. in 1995, the european parliament and council passed european directive 95/46/ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the data protection directive), which obligates the controller of an individuals personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. the data protection directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states. as these laws are interpreted throughout the european union where we have a significant commercial presence, compliance costs are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data security protections and data transfer mechanisms are in place. in july 2010, we submitted for review by relevant european data protection authorities our draft binding corporate rules for processing of data within the american express group which, once approved, will enable a more efficient basis on which to transfer data within our group.   in addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 46 states, the district of columbia, puerto rico and the virgin islands, have enacted data breach regulations and laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. data breach laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate, including japan, mexico and germany. in many countries that have yet to impose automatic data breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data breaches. many of these regulations also apply broadly to retailers/merchants that accept our cards; thus, to the extent they experience data security breaches, this presents additional risks for american express and our cardmembers.   in addition, federal legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted, could further restrict how the company collects, uses, shares and secures customer information, which could impact some of the companys current or planned business initiatives. for example, a recent ftc report, which applies to a companys collection and use of customer information both online and offline, would impose greater transparency, use, disclosure and consumer choice obligations on the company, and may ultimately result in the creation of an online mechanism through which consumers could opt out of all online tracking for online behavioral advertising purposes. a companion report by the united states department of commerce (doc) would require companies to be more transparent in their online privacy practices, and recommends the creation of a national data security/data breach standard. both the ftc and the doc are expected to release final reports by the end of 2011. additionally, two draft privacy bills were introduced in the 111th congress in the summer of 2010, and a number of federal legislators have either expressed their support for these draft bills or have indicated their intent to introduce new bills in the 112th congress. if adopted, any such privacy bill could have a significant impact on the companys current and planned data privacy and security practices, could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives.   we continue to seek ways to minimize these risks and costs internally by improving our own data privacy and security policies and practices, and externally through regular improvements to the pci data security standard and by placing strong contractual obligations on retailers/merchants that accept our cards, as well as on our service providers and business partners, relating to data security and data breach. we also have undertaken measures to assess the level of access to customer data by employees and our partners and service providers, and to ensure that such access is limited to the least privileged level necessary to perform their job or function for the company. still, increased regulation and enforcement activity throughout the world in the areas of data privacy and data security/breach may materially increase our costs and may decrease the number of our cards that we issue, or restrict our ability to fully exploit our closed-loop capability, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. our failure to comply with the privacy and data security/breach laws and regulations to which we are subject could also result in fines, sanctions and damage to our global reputation and our brand. 83 table of contents our success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.   our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. our senior management team is relatively small and we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry. the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. as further described in supervision and regulation  compensation practices on pages 52-53, our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of our depository institution subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the fdic and the ots (and beginning in july 2011, the occ). as a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the federal reserve, the fdic or other regulators worldwide. these limitations, including limitations on any incentive compensation policies pursuant to dodd-frank, could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.   litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.   businesses in the credit card industry have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits and patent claims. many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. in addition, we may be involved in various actions or proceedings brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of noncompliance with laws or regulations, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses and damage to our global reputation and our brand.   business risks   our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.   the payments industry is highly competitive and includes, in addition to charge, credit and debit card networks and issuers, cash, credit and ach, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators (e.g., paypal), wireless payment technologies (including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions), prepaid systems and systems linked to payment cards, and bank transfer models. we are the third largest general-purpose charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind visa and mastercard, which we believe are larger than we are in most countries. as a result, other card issuers may be able to benefit from the strong position and marketing and pricing power of visa and mastercard.   because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of significant issuers. continuing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a strong relationship with us being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor, resulting in a potential loss of business for us. the largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains intense. we are also subject to increasing pricing pressure from our competitors.   in addition, some of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have. we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats. our competitors may also be more efficient in introducing innovative products, programs and services than we are. spending on our cards could be impacted by consumer usage of debit cards, as we do not currently offer a 84 table of contents debit card linked to a deposit account, but we do issue various types of prepaid cards. in fact, the purchase volume and number of transactions made with debit cards in the united states has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions.   internationally, competition remains fierce, and as a result, we may not be successful in accelerating our growth outside of the united states through proprietary consumer, small business and corporate products, gns partners and alternative payment vehicles.   new technologies, together with the portability provided by smartphones and tablets and evolving consumer behavior with social networking, are rapidly changing the way people interact with each other and transact business all around the world. in this connection, traditional and non-traditional competitors such as mobile telecommunications companies are working to deliver digital and mobile payment services for both consumers and merchants.   in the united states, alternative payment vehicles that seek to redirect customers to payment systems based on ach continue to emerge and grow, and existing debit networks also continue to expand both on-and off-line and are making efforts to develop online pin functionality, which could further reduce the relative use of charge and credit cards online.   to the extent alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand in the online payments space, our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network could be negatively impacted. the company has recently created an enterprise growth group to focus on this strategic challenge by generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis, both organically and through acquisitions, in areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services. while expanding the enterprise growth group is a top priority for the company, many of the growth initiatives will involve new areas for the company and we may not be successful in executing our strategy.   regulators have recently put forward various proposals that may impact our businesses, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions, and proposals to impose taxes or fees on certain financial institutions. these or similar proposals, which may not apply to all of our competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.   we face increasingly intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants who accept our cards for payment for goods and services.   unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on cardmember spending. discount revenue, which represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. in recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. in addition, differentiated payment models from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate. as a priority in 2011, we are seeking to drive greater value to our merchants, which if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. if we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate or are unable to sustain merchant discount rates on our cards without experiencing overall volume growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.   we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through our marketing, promotion and rewards programs or to effectively control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our profitability.   our business is characterized by the high level of spending by our cardmembers. increasing consumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit and charge cards and travelers cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in card lending balances, depend in part on our 85 table of contents ability to develop and issue new or enhanced card and prepaid products and increase revenues from such products. one of the ways in which we attract new cardmembers, reduce cardmember attrition and seek to capture a greater share of customers total spending on cards issued on our network, both in the united states and in our international operations, is through our membership rewards program, as well as other cardmember benefits. we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand cardmember benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and cardmember services expenses. in addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and co-brand programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the future institute programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs.   during the last several years, we have received quarterly payments from each of visa and mastercard under the agreements that we entered into with each company to settle claims made against them in separate antitrust actions. we recognized $280 million ($172 million after-tax) from visa in 2010 and 2009, and $600 million ($372 million after-tax) from mastercard in 2010 and 2009. our ability to continue to invest in marketing, promotion and rewards programs, as well as our overall profitability, may be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the payments provided to us under our settlements with mastercard and visa once the aggregate settlement amounts have been paid in full through the second and fourth quarters of 2011, respectively.   our brand and reputation are key assets of our company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.   our brand and its attributes are key assets of the company. our ability to attract and retain consumer cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential cardmembers and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new cardmembers and maintain existing ones. adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.   we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions and investment activity.   we have recently acquired a number of businesses, including our acquisitions of serve, accertify and loyalty partner, which is pending. we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential transactions. these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. the process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. the areas where we face risks include: implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges; coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions; transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms; cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; retention of employees from the businesses we acquire; integration of the acquired companys accounting, management information, human resource, and other administrative systems; liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology. 86 table of contents our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.   an increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards.   we and other third parties store cardmember account information in connection with our charge and credit cards. criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture various types of information relating to cardmembers accounts, including membership rewards accounts, to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft. as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable and common way of doing business in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards. if data breaches or fraud levels involving our cards were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased concerns of customers relating to the privacy of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business.   we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our business. we are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.   in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. for example, we have partnered with costco and delta air lines to offer co-branded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits to cardmember participants. under some types of these contractual arrangements, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers. if we are not able to effectively manage the triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. similarly, we have credit risk to certain co-brand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that will not be fully redeemed for multi-year periods. we are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed business generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. for example, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse cardmembers for products and services purchased from merchants that are bankrupt or have ceased operations.   the airline industry represents a significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. during 2010, there continued to be significant consolidation in the airline industry, particularly in the united states (e.g., united airlines/continental airlines and the pending merger of southwest airlines and airtran), through mergers and/or grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances and joint ventures, and this trend could continue. in particular, the united states department of transportation has granted antitrust immunity to members of the skyteam, star and oneworld alliances, enabling the covered airlines to closely coordinate their cross-regional operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets, including jointly pricing and managing capacity on covered routes, sharing revenues and costs, and coordinating sales and corporate contracts, all outside of the scope of the u.s. antitrust laws. the european commission has similarly approved the oneworld alliance, and its review of the other alliances is continuing. increasing consolidation and expanded antitrust immunity could create challenges for our relationships with the airlines including by reducing our profitability on our airline business.   airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in our membership rewards program. if a participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in membership rewards, the combined airline would have to determine whether or not to continue participation. similarly, if one of our co-brand 87 table of contents airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing co-brand card, the combined airline would have to determine which co-brand cards it would offer. if an airline determined to withdraw from membership rewards or to cease offering an american express co-brand card, whether as the result of a merger or otherwise, such as our recent announcement that continental airlines will no longer participate in the airport club access program for centurion and platinum cardmembers or the membership rewards points transfer program as of october 1, 2011, our business could be adversely affected. for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see financial review  exposure to airline industry on page 60 of our 2010 annual report to shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.   our reengineering and other cost control initiatives may not prove successful, and we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we intended.   we have regularly undertaken, and are currently undertaking, a variety of efforts to reengineer our business operations in order to achieve cost savings and other benefits (including the reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing, promotion, rewards and infrastructure), enhance revenue-generating opportunities and improve our operating expense to revenue ratio both in the short-term and over time. these efforts include cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs and planned staff reductions relating to certain of these reengineering actions. if we do not successfully achieve these efforts in a timely manner or if we are not able to capitalize on these efforts, including the ability of the global services group to generate an annualized level of gross expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2012, or if the actions taken ultimately come at the expense of operational efficiency, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we intended. failure to achieve these benefits could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.   we must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, settlement risk with regard to gns partners, merchant bankruptcies, the rate of bankruptcies, and other credit trends that can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our card products.   credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. we are exposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from cardmember receivables and our other consumer lending activities, and institutional credit risk from merchants, gns partners and gcc clients. third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk. rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. higher write-off rates and an increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.   although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. in addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. we may also fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of our customers.   we must also effectively manage market risk to which we are exposed. market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables. we are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our card business and in our investment portfolios. changes in the interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the value of our assets and liabilities. if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net income, could fall. 88 table of contents we must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in our investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable.   additionally, we must effectively manage liquidity risk to which we are exposed. liquidity risk is defined as the inability to access cash and equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy our obligations. if we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, or we may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during a liquidity event. for additional information regarding our management of liquidity risk, see adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital above.   finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, human error or the external environment (i.e., natural disasters) including losses due to failures to comply with laws and regulations. operational risks include the risk that we may not comply with specific regulatory or legal requirements, exposing us to fines and/or penalties and possibly brand damage; employee error or intentional misconduct that results in a material financial misstatement; or a failure to monitor an outsource partners compliance with a service level agreement, resulting in economic harm to us.   although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective. see financial review  risk management on pages 48-50 of our 2010 annual report to shareholders for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. management of credit, market and operational risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.   an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.   as a source of funding, our banking subsidiaries offer deposits to individuals through brokerage networks as well as directly to consumers.   as of december 31, 2010, we had approximately $29.7 billion in total customer deposits. the majority of the companys outstanding u.s. retail deposits have been raised through third-party channels and, as such, are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. as part of our funding strategy, a majority of the deposits raised during 2010 were sourced directly by the company with consumers through personal savings from american express. many other financial services firms are increasing their use of deposit funding, and as such we may experience increased competition in the deposit markets, particularly as to brokerage networks. we cannot predict how this increased competition will affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.   our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits also is dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiaries. the fdia generally prohibits a bank, including our banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic. a bank that is less than well capitalized generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including direct-to-consumer deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national rate published by the fdic unless the fdic determines that the bank is operating in a high-rate area. an adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the fdic. undercapitalized depository institutions may not solicit deposits by offering interest rates that are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in such institutions normal market areas or in the market area in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted. there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to cease and 89 table of contents desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its federal regulator). if a depository institutions federal regulator determines that it is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with certain restrictions as if it were undercapitalized, and require an undercapitalized institution take certain actions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.   while centurion bank and aebfsb were considered well capitalized for these purposes as of december 31, 2009 and december 31, 2010, there can be no assurance that they will continue to meet this definition. basel iii, when implemented by the u.s. banking agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. additionally, our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses, including the interest rate we pay on deposits. an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.   if our global network systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all, our revenue and profitability would be materially reduced.   our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism or accident. a natural disaster or other problem at our facilities could interrupt our services. additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global network. if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services, adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenue and profitability.   we rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.   we operate a service network around the world.  in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors many of the computer systems and other services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses. a significant amount of this outsourcing occurs in developing countries. we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. in addition, the management of multiple third-party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. it is also possible that the cost efficiencies of certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for these services increases around the world.   our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters.   as previously disclosed, natural disasters, severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on the companys business. because the company derives a portion of its revenues from travel-related spending, its business is sensitive to disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel caused by such events. such disruptions can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies that the company offers and, if such disruptions to travel are prolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending. if the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   special note about
