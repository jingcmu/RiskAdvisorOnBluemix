item 1a.    risk factors         atk is subject to a number of risks, including those related to being a u.s. government contractor. some of the risks facing atk are discussed below. atk's business could be adversely impacted by reductions or changes in nasa or u.s. government military spending.         as the majority of atk's sales are to the u.s. government and its prime contractors, atk depends heavily on the contracts underlying these programs. significant portions of atk's sales come from a small number of contracts. atk's top five contracts, all of which are contracts with the u.s. government, accounted for approximately 27% of fiscal 2012 sales. atk's military small-caliber ammunition contract contributed approximately 15% of total fiscal 2012 sales. the loss or significant reduction of a material program in which atk participates could have a material adverse effect on atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.         atk's small-caliber ammunition operations for the u.s. military and u.s. allies are conducted at the lake city army ammunition plant ("lcaap" or "lake city") in independence, missouri. lake city is the army's principal small-caliber ammunition production facility and is the primary supplier of the u.s. military's small-caliber ammunition needs. atk took over operation of this facility on april 1, 2000 and is responsible for the operation and management, including leasing excess space to third parties in the private sector. atk is currently operating under a four-year supply contract with the u.s. 11 table of contents army as the primary supplier of small-caliber ammunition to the u.s. dod for both its training and tactical needs. production on this contract is expected to continue until september 2013. through the end of the current contract, atk will complete government funded projects for modernization of the facility. atk also has a facilities-use contract for the plant that expires in april 2025. although the facilities-use contract expires 11 years after the plant production contract, if the plant production contract is not renewed, atk believes the u.s. army would relieve atk of all of its obligations under the facilities-use contract. future atk production under this contract or levels of government spending cannot be predicted with certainty. for potential risks associated with the lake city contract competition, see the risk factor on competition discussed below.         congress and the president signed the nasa authorization act in october 2010 that directed the development of a space launch system. consistent with the nasa authorization act, the president's gfy 2012 budget released in february 2011 identified funding for the replacement to constellation's crew launch vehicle, designated the space launch system ("sls"). congress directed that, to the maximum extent possible, the sls should utilize hardware developed for the constellation program. on september 14, 2011, nasa and key legislative leaders jointly announced the baseline design for sls. atk's five-segment solid rocket motors were selected as the propulsion system for the first two sls test flights (2017 and 2021). at the same time, nasa announced that it will hold a competition for the final design of the propulsion system for sls, in which atk will be eligible to participate.         on november 18, 2011, president obama signed the gfy 2012 nasa appropriations bill, which provided $1.8 billion for the sls. this legislation further specified the configuration of the heavy lift vehicle consistent with the september 14, 2011 announcement by the nasa administrator on the sls configuration. the president's budget for government fiscal year 2013 includes a stable funding request for sls for gfy13 through gfy17. congress will determine the gfy13 funding level for nasa as well as the amount of the line item in nasa's budget for the sls program.         in fiscal 2012, nasa sales relating to the sls contracts were approximately $283 million and as of march 31, 2012 atk had approximately:  $54 million of billed and unbilled receivables directly related to the program,  $80 million of net property, plant, and equipment and other assets related to the sls and other contracts, and  $518 million of goodwill recorded related to the space systems operations reporting unit.         all of these assets would be subject to impairment testing if significant changes are made to the sls program and related contracts in future periods.         u.s. government contracts are also dependent on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. in august 2011, congress passed the budget control act (bca), which set ceilings for total defense and non-defense spending in u.s. government fiscal years 2012 and 2013. those limits were reflected in the enacted fiscal year 2012 department of defense appropriations act and the president's budget requests for the department of defense for fiscal year 2013. the bca also established a sequestration baseline of total federal spending for a ten-year period, assuming reductions in defense spending of $487 billion when compared to the ten year forecast submitted with the fiscal year 2012 president's budget request for the department of defense. failure by congress to fulfill the deficit reduction targets set in the bca will result in the sequestration of funds in each of the specified fiscal years to meet the total spending reduction target established by law. that sequestration, if fully implemented 12 table of contents over the ten-year period, could reduce funds available to the department of defense by up to $500 billion more than the reductions already assumed in the bca.         if sequestration were triggered by an absence of enacted legislation meeting the conditions of the bca or otherwise mitigating sequestration, the department of defense would be compelled to reduce obligations for each appropriated item within its budget. such reductions would likely result in the termination, modification or restructuring of procurement and services contracts currently in effect. department of defense officials have testified to congress that they have not commenced planning for sequestration or developing contingency plans to mitigate its impact. if sequestration were to occur in fiscal year 2013, most u.s. government contracts will be subject to modification if funding is changed. any failure by congress to appropriate additional funds to any program in which atk participates, or any contract modification as a result of funding changes or sequestration, could materially delay or terminate the program. this could have a material adverse effect on atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.         atk's contract to develop solid rocket boosters for nasa's sls heavy lift vehicle (hlv) could be impacted by sequestration in fiscal 2013. nasa will have greater discretion in allocating sequestration reductions due to the cost-plus nature of many nasa contracts and the different baseline for sequestration that affords nasa greater ability to set program priorities. atk is subject to intense competition and therefore may not be able to compete successfully.         atk encounters competition for most contracts and programs. some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources. atk's ability to compete for these contracts depends to a large extent upon:  its effectiveness and innovativeness of research and development programs,  its ability to offer better program performance at a lower cost than the competitors,  its readiness with respect to facilities, equipment, and personnel to undertake the programs for which it competes, and  its past performance and demonstrated capabilities.         in some instances, the u.s. government directs a program to a single supplier. in these cases, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the programs involved, but they can only enter or reenter the market if the u.s. government chooses to open the particular program to competition. atk's sole-source contracts accounted for 32% of u.s. government sales in fiscal 2012 and include the following programs: rsrm space shuttle boosters, sls, trident ii missiles, minuteman iii propulsion replacement program, advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, hellfire, sensor fuzed weapon propulsion systems, multi-purpose tank ammunition rounds, tank ammunition, the aar-47 missile warning system, javelin launch tubes, sm-3 solid divert and attitude control systems and third stage rocket motors, startm motors, advanced anti-radiation guided missile ("aargm"), mobile ground-to-air radar jamming system, spider barrier system, and the individual semi-automatic airburst system ("isaas").         in the commercial ammunition and accessories markets, atk competes against manufacturers that have well-established brand names and strong market positions. competitive responses to market dynamics and commodity cost fluctuations could impact the marketplace and cause adverse impacts to atk financial results.         the downsizing of the munitions industrial base has resulted in a reduction in the number of competitors through consolidations and departures from the industry. this has reduced the number of competitors for some contracts and programs, but has strengthened the capabilities of some of the remaining competitors. in addition, it is possible that there will be increasing competition from the 13 table of contents remaining competitors in business areas where they do not currently compete, particularly in those business areas dealing with electronics.         atk submitted its proposal for the continued operation of the lcaap on january 23, 2012, in response to a competitive solicitation issued by the u.s. army. the contract is expected to be awarded in the fall of 2012. atk is currently under contract with the u.s. army to operate the lcaap until september 2013. loss of the lake city contract would reduce armament systems' and atk's sales and profit. the prime contract at lake city, which includes modernization, accounted for approximately 15% of atk's total revenue in fiscal 2012.         on september 14, 2011, nasa and key legislative leaders jointly announced the baseline design for sls. atk's five-segment solid rocket motors were selected as the propulsion system for the first two sls test flights (2017 and 2021). at the same time, nasa announced that it will hold a competition in 2015 for the final design of the propulsion system for sls, in which atk will be eligible to participate. atk may not be able to react to increases in its costs due to the nature of its u.s. government contracts.         atk's u.s. government contracts can be categorized as either "cost-plus" or "fixed-price."         cost-plus contracts.    cost-plus contracts are cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, or cost-plus-award-fee contracts. cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts allow atk to recover its approved costs plus a fixed fee. cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts and cost-plus-award-fee contracts allow atk to recover its approved costs plus a fee that can fluctuate based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule, and performance. the award or incentive fees that are typically associated with these programs are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. in these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise.         fixed-price contracts.    fixed-price contracts are firm-fixed-price, fixed-price-incentive, or fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts. under firm-fixed-price contracts, atk agrees to perform certain work for a fixed price and absorb any cost underruns or overruns. fixed-price-incentive contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the final contract price may be adjusted based on total final costs compared to total target cost, and may be affected by schedule and performance. fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts allow for a fixed price per labor hour, subject to a contract cap. all fixed-price contracts present the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. if the initial estimates used to calculate the contract price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. in addition, some contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule, and performance. if atk fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts, the cost to perform the work could increase or atk's price could be reduced, which would adversely affect the company's financial condition. the u.s. government also regulates the accounting methods under which costs are allocated to u.s. government contracts.         the following table summarizes how much each of these types of contracts contributed to atk's u.s. government business in fiscal 2012: cost-plus contracts:         cost-plus-fixed-fee     14 % cost-plus-incentive-fee/cost-plus-award-fee     22 % fixed-price contracts:         firm-fixed-price     64 %         total     100 % 14 table of contents atk uses estimates in accounting for its programs. changes in estimates could affect atk's financial results.         contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues, including the impact of scope change negotiations, estimating program costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. due to the size and nature of many of atk's contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. similarly, many assumptions are made regarding the future impacts of such things as the business base, efficiency initiatives, cost reduction efforts, and contract changes and claim recovery. incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. estimates of award and incentive fees are also used in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.         because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if atk used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. additional information on atk's accounting policies for revenue recognition can be found under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the section titled "critical accounting policies" in item 7 of this report. atk's u.s. government contracts are subject to termination.         atk is subject to the risk that the u.s. government may terminate its contracts with its suppliers, either for convenience or in the event of a default by the contractor. if a cost-plus contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to reimbursement of its approved costs. if the contractor would have incurred a loss had the entire contract been performed, then no profit is allowed by the u.s. government. if the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive payment of a total fee proportionate to the percentage of the work completed under the contract. if a fixed-price contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to receive payment for items delivered to and accepted by the u.s. government. if the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by terminated subcontractors, other settlement expenses, and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed. while the contractor is entitled to these claims under either type of contract, there can be no assurance that these amounts will be recovered. if a contract termination is for default:  the contractor is paid an amount agreed upon for completed and partially completed products and services accepted by the u.s. government,  the u.s. government is not liable for the contractor's costs for unaccepted items, and is entitled to repayment of any advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract, and  the contractor may be liable for excess costs incurred by the u.s. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. atk could experience a change or reduction in demand for commercial ammunition.         in recent years, atk has seen a significant increase in demand for commercial ammunition. although atk services a broad base of customers, there is no assurance the recent growth rate can be sustained, which could have an impact on the company's operating results. in addition, a further shift in consumer demand toward lower-margin products could have an adverse impact on the company's operating results. 15 table of contents atk is exposed to risks associated with expansion into commercial markets.         atk's long-term business growth strategy includes expansion into markets such as commercial aerospace structures. such efforts involve a number of risks, including increased capital expenditures, market uncertainties, schedule delays, performance risk, extended payment terms, diversion of management attention, additional credit risk associated with new customers, and costs incurred in competing with companies with strong brand names and market positions. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect atk's earnings and cash flows.         atk's earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income recorded for employee benefit plans, primarily pension plans and other postretirement plans. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the united states of america require atk to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations are based on assumptions made relating to financial market and other economic conditions. changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in these assumptions. the key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expense or income for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates, and the health care cost trend rate. atk is required to remeasure its plan assets and benefit obligations annually, which may result in a significant change to equity through other comprehensive income (loss). atk's pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense can also be affected by legislation or other regulatory actions. additional information on how atk's financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies can be found under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the section titled "critical accounting policies" in item 7 of this report. international sales are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries.         over the next several years, atk intends to focus on the expansion of our business into international markets. in fiscal 2012, approximately 15% of atk's sales were to foreign customers, compared to 14% in the prior year. atk's international business may pose greater risks than its business in the united states because in some countries there is increased potential for changes in economic, legal and political environments. atk's international business is also sensitive to changes in a foreign government's national priorities and budgets. international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems and customs in other countries. in addition, some international customers require contractors to agree to offset programs that may require in-country purchases or manufacturing or financial support arrangements as a condition to awarding contracts. the contracts may include penalties in the event the company fails to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. foreign sales subject atk to numerous stringent u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, exchange controls, the foreign corrupt practices act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the u.s. export administration act. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in material adverse consequences to atk. 16 table of contents other risks associated with u.s. government contracts may expose atk to adverse consequences.         in addition, like all u.s. government contractors, atk is subject to risks associated with uncertain cost factors related to:  scarce technological skills and components,  the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of design completion, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns,  the substantial time and effort required for design and development,  design complexity,  rapid obsolescence, and  the potential need for design improvement. atk has a substantial amount of debt, and the cost of servicing that debt could adversely affect atk's business and hinder atk's ability to make payments on its debt.         as of march 31, 2012, atk had total debt of $1.3 billion. in addition, atk had $175.8 million of outstanding but undrawn letters of credit and, taking into account these letters of credit, an additional $424.2 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. additional information on atk's debt can be found under "liquidity and capital resources" in item 7 of this report.         atk has demands on its cash resources in addition to interest and principal payments on its debt including, among others, operating expenses. atk's level of indebtedness, possible interest rate increases, and these significant demands on atk's cash resources could:  make it more difficult for atk to satisfy its obligations,  require atk to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, and other general corporate purposes,  limit atk's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the defense and aerospace industries,  place atk at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility,  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants applicable to atk's indebtedness, among other things, atk's ability to borrow additional funds,  increase atk's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, and  result in a default event upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in atk's senior credit facilities which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on atk's business, financial condition, or results of operations.         atk's ability to pay interest on and repay its long-term debt and to satisfy its other liabilities will depend upon future operating performance and atk's ability to refinance its debt as it becomes due. atk's future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by prevailing economic conditions at that time and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond atk's control. 17 table of contents         if atk is unable to service its indebtedness and fund operating costs, atk will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:  reducing or delaying expenditures for capital equipment and/or share repurchases,  seeking additional debt financing or equity capital,  selling assets, or  restructuring or refinancing debt.         there can be no assurance that any such strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. atk's business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions.         as a defense contractor, atk faces certain security threats, including threats to its information technology infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to its proprietary or classified information. atk's information technology networks and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of its business and essential to its ability to perform day-to-day operations. loss of security within this critical operational infrastructure could disrupt atk's operations, require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on atk's performance.         atk also manages information technology systems for various customers. while atk maintains information security policies and procedures for managing these systems, the company generally faces the same security threats for these systems as for its own systems. computer viruses, malware, attempts to gain access to customer data or other electronic security breaches could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems for atk's customers, unauthorized release of confidential or personally identifiable information and corruption of customer data.         these events could damage atk's reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions it must take, potential liability to customers and litigation expenses. disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact atk.         key raw materials used in atk's operations include aluminum, steel, steel alloys, copper, zinc, lead, graphite fiber, prepreg, hydroxy terminated polybutadiene, epoxy resins and adhesives, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers, cotton fiber, wood pulp cellulose, diethylether, x-ray film, plasticizers and nitrate esters, impregnated ablative materials, various natural and synthetic rubber compounds, polybutadiene, acrylonitrile, and ammonium perchlorate. atk also purchases chemicals; electronic, electro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are integrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems.         atk monitors sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available. as a u.s. government contractor, atk is frequently limited to procuring materials and components from sources of supply approved by the u.s. dod. in addition, as business conditions, the dod budget, and congressional allocations change, suppliers of specialty chemicals and materials sometimes consider dropping low volume items from their product lines, which may require, as it has in the past, qualification of new suppliers for raw materials on key programs. the supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in atk's operations, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry. this single source, however, maintains two separate manufacturing lines a reasonable distance apart, which mitigates the likelihood of a fire, explosion, or other problem impacting all production. atk may also rely on one primary supplier for other production materials. although other suppliers of the same materials may exist, the addition of a new supplier may require atk to qualify the new 18 table of contents source for use. the qualification process may impact atk's profitability or ability to meet contract deliveries.         certain suppliers of materials used in the manufacturing of rocket motors have discontinued the production of some materials. these materials include certain insulation and resin materials for rocket motor cases and aerospace-grade rayon for nozzles. atk has qualified new replacement materials for some programs. for other programs, atk or atk's customer has procured sufficient inventory to cover current program requirements and is in the process of qualifying new replacement materials to be qualified in time to meet future production needs. atk's profitability may be affected if unforeseen difficulties in developing and qualifying replacement materials occur.         atk is also impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on commercial and fixed-price business. atk has seen a significant fluctuation in the prices of commodity metals, including copper, lead, steel, and zinc. the fluctuating costs of natural gas and electricity also have an impact on the cost of operating atk's factories.         prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of atk's key raw materials, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials and energy could have a material adverse effect on atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. atk is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations, non-compliance with which may expose atk to adverse consequences.         atk is subject to extensive and complex u.s. government procurement laws and regulations, along with ongoing u.s. government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance, and administration. atk could suffer adverse consequences if it were to fail to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations or with laws governing the export of controlled products and commodities; or commit a significant violation of any other federal law. these consequences could include contract termination; civil and criminal penalties; and, under certain circumstances, atk's suspension and debarment from future u.s. government contracts for a period of time. in addition, foreign sales are subject to greater variability and risk than atk's domestic sales. foreign sales subject atk to numerous stringent u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, exchange controls, the foreign corrupt practices act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the u.s. export administration act. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in material adverse consequences to atk.         in addition to the regulation-related risks identified above, the manufacture, sale and purchase of firearms and ammunition are also subject to extensive governmental regulation on the federal, state and local levels. changes in regulation could materially adversely affect our business by restricting the types of products we manufacture or sell or by imposing additional costs on us or our customers in connection with the manufacture or sale of our products. regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions. while we do not believe that existing federal and state legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition had a material adverse effect on our sales, no assurance can be given that more restrictive regulations, if proposed or enacted, will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 19 table of contents novation of u.s. government contracts involves risk.         when u.s. government contracts are transferred from one contractor to another, such as in connection with the sale of a business, the u.s. government may require that the parties enter into a novation agreement. a novation agreement generally provides that:  the transferring contractor guarantees or otherwise assumes liability for the performance of the acquiring contractor's obligations under the contract,  the acquiring contractor assumes all obligations under the contract, and  the u.s. government recognizes the transfer of the contract and related assets. failure of atk's subcontractors to perform their contractual obligations could materially and adversely impact atk's prime contract performance and ability to obtain future business.         atk relies on subcontracts with other companies to perform a portion of the services atk provides its customers on many of its contracts. there is a risk that atk may have disputes with its subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, atk's failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, or atk's hiring of personnel of a subcontractor. a failure by one or more of atk's subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact atk's ability to perform its obligations as the prime contractor. subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. a default termination could expose atk to liability and have a material adverse effect on the ability to compete for future contracts and orders. atk's future success will depend, in part, on its ability to develop new technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers.         virtually all of the products produced and sold by atk are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration techniques and capabilities. both the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. the product and program needs of atk's government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. accordingly, atk's future performance in part depends on its ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. in addition, because of the highly specialized nature of its business, atk must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers. atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows may be adversely affected if it is unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel. due to the volatile and flammable nature of its products, fires or explosions may disrupt atk's business.         many of atk's products involve the manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. from time to time, these activities have resulted in incidents which have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. atk has safety and loss prevention programs which require detailed pre-construction reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. however, atk cannot ensure that it will not experience similar incidents in the future or that any similar incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 20 table of contents atk is subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern both past practices and current compliance which may expose atk to adverse consequences.         atk's operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those for discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. at certain sites that atk owns or operates or formerly owned or operated, there is known or potential contamination that atk is required to investigate, remediate, or provide resource restoration. atk could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, resource restoration costs, fines, and penalties, or third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of liabilities associated with past practices or violations of environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits.         atk expects that a portion of its environmental compliance and remediation costs will be recoverable under u.s. government contracts. some of the remediation costs that are not recoverable from the u.s. government that are associated with facilities purchased in a business acquisition may be covered by various indemnification agreements, as described below.  as part of its acquisition of the hercules aerospace company in fiscal 1995, atk generally assumed responsibility for environmental compliance at the facilities acquired from hercules (the "hercules facilities"). atk believes that a portion of the compliance and remediation costs associated with the hercules facilities will be recoverable under u.s. government contracts. if atk were unable to recover those environmental remediation costs under these contracts, atk believes these costs will be covered by hercules incorporated, a subsidiary of ashland inc., ("hercules") under environmental agreements entered into in connection with the hercules acquisition. under these agreements, hercules has agreed to indemnify atk for environmental conditions relating to releases or hazardous waste activities occurring prior to atk's purchase of the hercules facilities as long as they were identified in accordance with the terms of the agreement; fines relating to pre-acquisition environmental compliance; and environmental claims arising out of breaches of hercules' representations and warranties. hercules is not required to indemnify atk for any individual claims below $50 thousand. hercules is obligated to indemnify atk for the lowest cost response of remediation required at the facility that is acceptable to the applicable regulatory agencies. atk is not responsible for conducting any remedial activities with respect to the clearwater, fl facility. in accordance with its agreement with hercules, atk notified hercules of all known contamination on non-federal lands on or before march 31, 2000, and on federal lands on or before march 31, 2005.  atk generally assumed responsibility for environmental compliance at the thiokol facilities acquired from alcoa inc. ("alcoa") in fiscal 2002. atk expects that a portion of the compliance and remediation costs associated with the acquired thiokol facilities will be recoverable under u.s. government contracts. in accordance with its agreement with alcoa, atk notified alcoa of all known environmental remediation issues as of january 30, 2004. of these known issues, atk is responsible for any costs not recovered through u.s. government contracts at thiokol facilities up to $29 million, atk and alcoa have agreed to split evenly any amounts between $29 million and $49 million, and atk is responsible for any payments in excess of $49 million. at this time, atk believes that costs not recovered through u.s. government contracts will be immaterial.         atk cannot ensure that the u.s. government, hercules, alcoa, or other third parties will reimburse it for any particular environmental costs or reimburse atk in a timely manner or that any claims for indemnification will not be disputed. u.s. government reimbursements for cleanups are financed out of a particular agency's operating budget and the ability of a particular governmental agency to make timely reimbursements for cleanup costs will be subject to national budgetary constraints. atk's failure to obtain full or timely reimbursement from the u.s. government, hercules, 21 table of contents alcoa, or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.         in december 2001, atk received notice from the state of utah of a potential claim against atk under section 107(f) of the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") for natural resource damages at bacchus, one of the hercules facilities, in magna, utah. the notice letter, which was issued to preserve the state's rights under cercla, also expressly acknowledged the state's willingness to allow atk to go forward with its currently-planned monitoring and remediation program. the state's preliminary estimate of damages contained in this claim was $139 million, which is based on known and alleged groundwater contamination at and near bacchus and is related to hercules' manufacturing operations at the site. atk has had discussions with the state regarding this claim and entered into a tolling agreement with the state in fiscal 2002. in fiscal 2003, atk entered into a similar tolling agreement with the state regarding the promontory facility that was acquired from alcoa in the acquisition of thiokol. these agreements allow atk time to continue to identify and address the contamination by the normal and planned regulatory remediation processes in utah. the tolling agreements expire in january 2016 and september 2012, respectively. although atk has previously made accruals for its best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs related to the remediation obligations known to atk with respect to the affected areas, atk cannot yet predict if or when a suit may be filed against it, nor can atk determine any additional costs that may be incurred in connection with this matter.         while atk has environmental management programs in place to mitigate risks, environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future. capital market volatility could adversely impact atk's earnings because of atk's capital structure.         as of march 31, 2012, atk had a total of $199 million of convertible senior subordinated notes outstanding, subject to the terms of the indenture. the indenture requires atk to satisfy up to the principal amount of these notes solely in cash. in addition, the indenture requires atk to pay any additional amounts above the principal amount of the notes in cash, common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock at atk's discretion. as the price of atk's common stock increases above the conversion price of the notes, atk includes the dilutive impact of the number of shares that would be issued if converted, which decreases earnings per share.         atk is also exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates. if interest rates increase, atk may incur increased interest expense on variable interest-rate debt or short-term borrowings, which could have an adverse impact on atk's operating results and cash flows. atk may pursue or complete acquisitions, or other transactions, which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.         atk's business strategy includes the potential for future acquisitions or other transactions. acquisitions involve a number of risks including integration of the acquired company with atk's operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. atk cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any future acquisitions will be realized. costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact atk's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. futhermore, atk may engage in other strategic business transactions. such transactions could cause unanticipated costs and difficulties, may 22 table of contents not achieve intended results, and may require significant time and attention from management which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. atk's profitability could be impacted by unanticipated changes in its tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.         atk's business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting income tax expense and profitability. in addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in income tax expense. atk is involved in a number of legal proceedings. we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.         atk is subject to lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) which arise out of the conduct of atk's business. resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and atk's business may be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of these matters that cannot be predicted with certainty. moreover, atk's potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy, or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. additional information can be found in item 3 of this report. item 1b.    unresolved
