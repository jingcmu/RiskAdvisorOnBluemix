item 1a. risk factors our future operating results could differ materially from the results described in this annual report on form 10-k due to the risks and uncertainties described below. you should consider carefully the following information about risks below in evaluating our business. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements. see “note regarding forward-looking statements” in this annual report on form 10-k. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below. risks related to our business if we incur operating losses for longer than we expect, or we are not able to raise additional capital, we may be unable to continue our operations, or we may become insolvent. our net losses for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, were $30.1 million, $11.3 million, and $23.3 million, respectively. we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years as we continue research and clinical development of our technologies and pursue partnering opportunities, regulatory strategies, commercialization, and related activities, and such losses may increase as a result of our recent acquisition of 4-ab (the "acquisition"). furthermore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the success of our licensees and collaborative partners, as well as the likelihood and timing of new strategic licensing and partnering relationships and/or successful development and commercialization of vaccines containing qs-21 stimulon, our prophage series vaccines and our other product candidates. from our inception through december 31, 2013, we have incurred net losses totaling $649.1 million. on december 31, 2013, we had $27.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that, based on our current plans and activities, our working capital resources at december 31, 2013 along with the net proceeds from our equity offering in february 2014 of approximately $56.0 million, and potential proceeds from license, supply, and collaborative agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through the first half of 2015. we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our funds although additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our average monthly cash used in operating activities was approximately $1.6 million. we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures during 2014. we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities. in order to finance future operations, we will be required to raise additional funds in the capital markets, through arrangements with collaborative partners, or from other sources. additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them or if we incur operating losses for longer than we expect, we may not be able to continue some or all of our operations, or we may become insolvent. we also may be forced to license or sell technologies to others under agreements that allocate to third parties substantial portions of the potential value of these technologies. there are a number of factors that will influence our future capital requirements, including, without limitation, the following: 13 table of contents •the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue; • the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our future product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical trials; • the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our and our licensees' product candidates; •the cost of manufacturing; • our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; • the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights; • the costs associated with any successful commercial operations; and •the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any.  general economic conditions in the united states economy and abroad may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition, particularly if our ability to raise additional funds is impaired. the ability of potential patients and/or health care payers to pay for our products could also be adversely impacted, thereby limiting our potential revenue. in addition, any negative impacts from any deterioration in the credit markets on our collaborative partners could limit potential revenue from our product candidates. we have significant debt, and we may not be able to make interest or principal payments when due. in april 2013 we exchanged our 8% senior secured convertible notes due august 2014 (the "2006 notes"), including accrued and unpaid interest, for $10.0 million in cash, 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, a revenue interest in certain qs-21 stimulon partnered programs and a royalty interest in herpv. the $10.0 million cash payment was financed by entering into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank for a $5.0 million loan that bears interest at 6.75% annually (the "svb loan"), and a note purchase agreement with various investors to issue senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million with annual interest at 10% (the "subordinated notes"). the svb loan is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately $278,000 due monthly beginning november 2013 and ending in april 2015. the subordinated notes are due in april 2015. our ability to satisfy our obligations under this indebtedness will depend upon our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including the factors identified in this “risk factors” section and other factors beyond our control. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness, we may be required, among other things, to: •seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; •refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; •sell, out-license, or otherwise dispose of assets; and/or •reduce or delay planned expenditures on research and development and/or commercialization activities. such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to make principal and interest payments. in addition, any such financing, refinancing, or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all. other than for the year ended december 31, 2012, we have had negative cash flows from operations. the net cash provided by operations of $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily resulted from one-time payments received under amended license agreements and therefore our net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2012 is not indicative of future results. for the years ended december 31, 2013, and 2011, net cash used in operating activities was $19.5 million, and $16.2 million, respectively. our outstanding debt instruments contain significant restrictive and affirmative covenants. 14 table of contents the svb loan is secured by a lien against substantially all of our assets as well as the assets of our subsidiary antigenics inc., and contains, among other things, a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to: •     incur certain additional indebtedness; •     make certain investments; •           pay dividends other than dividends required pursuant to pre-existing commitments; •           make payments on subordinated indebtedness other than regularly scheduled payments of interest; •     create certain liens; •     consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of our assets; and/or •     change our line of business. the svb loan also specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable cure periods), including, among other things: •        covenant defaults; •       other non-payment defaults; •          bankruptcy; •          certain penalties and judgments from a governmental authority; •          cross-defaults in respect of indebtedness over $50,000; and •          insolvency defaults. additionally, any material adverse change with respect to us or antigenics inc., constitutes an event of default. upon the occurrence of an event of default under the svb loan, subject to cure periods in certain circumstances, the lender may declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and may foreclose upon our assets that secure the svb loan. during the continuance of an event of default which does not accelerate the maturity of the svb loan, interest will accrue at a default rate equal to the otherwise applicable rate plus 5%. we may prepay the svb loan at any time, in full, subject to certain notice requirement and a prepayment premium equal to 4% of the outstanding principal amount of the svb loan. the subordinated notes also include default provisions which allow for the acceleration of the principal payment of the subordinated notes in the event we become involved in certain bankruptcy proceedings, become insolvent, fail to make a payment of principal or (after a grace period) interest on the subordinated notes, default on other indebtedness with an aggregate principal balance of $5 million or more if such default has the effect of accelerating the maturity of such indebtedness, or become subject to a legal judgment or similar order for the payment of money in an amount greater than $5 million if such amount will not be covered by third-party insurance. if we default on the svb loan or the subordinated notes and the repayment of such indebtedness is accelerated, our liquidity will be materially and adversely affected. we may not receive anticipated qs-21 stimulon revenues from our licensees. with the exception of our herpv program, we currently rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon third party licensees, particularly glaxosmithkline (“gsk”) and janssen alzheimer immunotherapy (“janssen ai”), to develop, test, market and manufacture vaccines that utilize our qs-21 stimulon adjuvant. we expect that we will rely on similar relationships if we develop new adjuvants in our saponin platform. in return for rights to use qs-21 stimulon, our licensees have generally agreed to pay us license fees, milestone payments and royalties on product sales for a minimum of 10 years after commercial launch, with some exceptions. as each licensee controls its own product development process, we cannot predict our licensees' requirements for qs-21 stimulon in the future or to what extent, if any, they will develop vaccines that use qs-21 stimulon as an adjuvant. our licensees may initiate or terminate programs containing qs-21 stimulon at any time. clinical trials being conducted by our licensees, including those being conducted by gsk and janssen ai, may not be successful. the results of these trials and other factors may cause our licensees to terminate programs containing qs-21 stimulon. in the event that our licensees develop vaccines using qs-21 stimulon, there is no guarantee that these products will obtain regulatory approval or, if so approved, will generate significant royalties, if any, or that we will be able to collect royalties in the future. in addition, where we had previously supplied gsk and janssen ai with all their requirements of qs-21 stimulon, we have amended our agreements so that they are permitted to manufacture their own qs-21 stimulon. we are unable to predict what amount of qs-21 stimulon, if any, will be purchased from us by other licensees or collaborators in the future. any inability to receive anticipated qs-21 stimulon revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 table of contents in connection with the exchange of our 2006 notes, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with the holders of the 2006 notes. this agreement granted these holders a contractual right to the proceeds of 20% of our revenue interests from qs-21 stimulon partnered programs and a 0.5% royalty on net sales of herpv. due to uncertainties surrounding the future revenue stream generated from our licensees, we are unable to predict the precise dollar value reduction in revenue that will result from this agreement to pay the 2006 note holders their share of the proceeds from qs-21 stimulon and herpv programs. any reduction in revenues generated from qs-21 stimulon could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our herpv therapeutic vaccine candidate is in early stage development and we may not be able to successfully develop this candidate. based on the results of our phase 1 clinical trial of herpv, which includes qs-21 stimulon, we advanced this product candidate into a phase 2 trial that measured the effect of vaccination on viral shedding in individuals infected with hsv-2 (genital herpes). in november 2013, we announced that the phase 2 trial met its primary endpoint, a statistically significant reduction in viral shedding. additional study results, including booster and immune response data, are expected during the first half of 2014. while our clinical trials to date have yielded positive findings, they were limited in size and scope. there is no guarantee that future clinical trials will be successful, that a reduction in viral shedding will translate into clinical benefit, or that the safety profile will be considered acceptable. in addition, we may not have the resources required to advance the vaccine further and even if we do have such resources, the success of future clinical trials will be dependent on, upon other things, maintaining sufficient supply of the required investigational materials, enrolling sufficient patients and the adherence of these patients to the study protocol. our herpv development program in general may not be successful or yield a partnering opportunity for us. furthermore, it is possible that research and discoveries by others will render our product candidate obsolete or noncompetitive. we may not be able to market and sell vaccines from our prophage series. the probability and timing of submissions and/or approval of prophage series vaccines is uncertain. a phase 2 trial testing the prophage series g-100 vaccine candidate in newly diagnosed glioma has been fully enrolled and patient follow up is ongoing. while early data from this study have been encouraging, these data may not be supported in later follow-up of patients or in subsequent clinical trials. separately, the alliance for clinical trials in oncology, a cooperative group of the nci, opened patient enrollment in a randomized phase 2 trial of the prophage series g-200 vaccine in combination with avastin® (bevacizumab) in patients with surgically resectable recurrent glioma. this trial may not meet enrollment expectations and/or it might not be successful, and even if it is successful, the trial is not intended to provide the necessary evidence of efficacy and/or safety to support biologics license application ("bla") filings. due to our lack of resources, our ability to perform additional studies may be limited. in addition, studies may take years to complete and may fail to support regulatory filings for many reasons. our prophage series vaccines are a novel class of patient-specific (derived from the patient's own tumor) oncology therapies, and the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") and foreign regulatory agencies, including the european medicines agency, which is responsible for product approvals in europe, and health canada, which is responsible for product approvals in canada, have limited experience in reviewing these types of therapies. therefore, product candidates derived from the prophage series vaccines may experience high development costs and a long regulatory review process, either of which could delay or prevent commercialization efforts. if we or our licensee are unable to purify heat shock proteins we may have difficulty successfully initiating or completing clinical trials or supporting commercial sales. even if we or our licensees do successfully complete ongoing or future clinical trials or are successful manufacturing any approved products, we may have difficulty generating a sizable market or commercial sales. our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the prophage series vaccines for a particular cancer depends in part on our, and following successful technology transfer to newvac llc ("newvac"), our licensee for oncophage in the russian federation and certain other cis countries, its ability to purify heat shock proteins from that type of cancer. if we or newvac experience difficulties in purifying heat shock proteins for a sufficiently large number of patients in our clinical trials, we may face delays in enrolling sufficient patients and subsequently utilize more internal resources to satisfy enrollment requirements. manufacturing failures may also lower the probability of a successful analysis of the data from clinical trials and, ultimately, the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and generate commercial sales. manufacturing difficulties may also adversely affect newvac’s ability to commercialize oncophage in its licensed territory. we have successfully manufactured product across many different cancer types, however, the success rate per indication has varied. we have evolved our manufacturing processes to better accommodate a wider range of tumor types. our current manufacturing technologies have been successful in manufacturing product from approximately 92% of the rcc tumors received and approximately 85% of the tumors received from patients enrolled in phase 2 clinical trials in glioma. in addition, we may encounter problems with other types of cancer or patients as we expand our research. if we cannot overcome these problems, the number of patients or cancer 16 table of contents types that our heat shock protein product candidates could treat would be limited. in addition, if we commercialize our heat shock protein product candidates, we may not be able to replicate past manufacturing success rates and we may face claims from patients for whom we are unable to produce a vaccine. manufacturing problems or increased demand may cause delays, unanticipated costs, or loss of revenue streams. if the future clinical or commercial demand for our products or product candidates is substantially greater than we anticipate, our capacity may not be able to meet product demand. in addition, higher manufacturing loads may result in higher manufacturing failure rates as the operation becomes more complex. we currently manufacture our prophage series vaccines in our lexington, ma facility. while we believe we will be able to cover demand in the near term, there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet all future or unanticipated increases in demand, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our business. such demand may also limit our ability to manufacture product in support of clinical trials, and this could cause a delay or failure in our prophage series vaccine development programs. manufacturing of prophage series vaccines is complex, and various factors could cause delays or an inability to supply vaccine. deviations in the processes controlling manufacture could result in production failures. furthermore, we have limited manufacturing resources and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary resources, timely or at all, to meet any increased demand. regulatory bodies may require us to make our manufacturing facility a single product facility. in such an instance, we would no longer have the ability to manufacture products other than prophage series vaccines in our current facility. except in the case of gsk and janssen ai, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for qs-21 stimulon. we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for qs-21 stimulon for our other existing and future qs-21 stimulon manufacturing and supply needs, and we have a supply agreement with a contract manufacturer for the production of qs-21 stimulon through september 2014. if we are not able to renew this agreement we may not be able to supply qs-21 stimulon to meet future supply obligations on favorable terms or at all. for example, although gsk is a source of qs-21 stimulon supply for us, their obligation to supply is for a limited duration, and various factors could impact our decision to exercise this right. in addition, we or our currently contracted suppliers may not have the ability to manufacture commercial grade qs-21 stimulon. we currently rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon third parties, potentially including our collaborators or licensees, to produce materials required to support our product candidates, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and commercial efforts. a number of factors could cause production interruptions at our manufacturing facility or at our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including equipment malfunctions, labor or employment retention problems, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist activities, or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. alternatively, there is the possibility we may have excess manufacturing capacity if product candidates do not progress as planned. there are a limited number of contract manufacturers or suppliers that are capable of manufacturing our product candidates or the materials used in their manufacture. if we are unable to do so ourselves or to arrange for third-party manufacturing or supply of these product candidates or materials, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of these product candidates or commercialize them ourselves or through our collaborative partners or licensees. reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control, and the possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. biopharmaceutical manufacturing is also subject to extensive government regulation. components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp. these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of product candidates. in addition, facilities are subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing processes may require additional regulatory approvals, either of which could cause us to incur significant additional costs and lose revenue. risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our business. we have in the past, and may continue to seek, marketing and regulatory approvals of our product candidates in non-u.s. jurisdictions. for example, our oncophage vaccine is approved for sale in russia for the treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence, and we have partnered with newvac to commercialize this product in the russian federation. in addition, due to the acquisition, we now have research and development operations in switzerland and germany. various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our success. possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign and domestic currencies, disruptions in the import, export, and transportation of patient tumors and our product, the 17 table of contents product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign relationships, the performance of our licensees or collaborators, geopolitical instability, and unexpected regulatory, economic, or political changes in foreign markets. see “risk factors- even if we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, such product approvals could be subject to restrictions or withdrawals. regulatory requirements are subject to change.” and "risk factors - we may fail to realize the benefits we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition." if we, or our licensees, fail to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our product candidates there may be no commercially viable market for these products, or the commercial potential of these products may be significantly limited. public and private insurance programs may determine that they will not cover our product candidates or the product candidates of our licensees. government-sponsored health care systems typically pay a substantial share of health care costs, and they may regulate reimbursement levels of products to control costs. if we or our licensees are unsuccessful in obtaining substantial reimbursement for our product candidates from national or regional funds, we will have to rely on private-pay, which may delay or prevent our launch efforts, because the ability and willingness of patients to pay for our products is unclear. we, or our licensees, may not be able to obtain health insurance coverage of our product candidates, and if coverage is obtained, it may be substantially delayed, or there may be significant restrictions on the circumstances in which the products would be reimbursed. we are unable to predict what impact any future regulation or third-party payer initiatives relating to reimbursement will have on our sales.  our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources. our product candidates and the product candidates in development by our collaborative partners may fail because of competition from major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies that market products, or that are engaged in the development of product candidates, directed at cancer, infectious diseases and degenerative disorders. many of our competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have greater financial and human resources and more experience than we do. our competitors may: •      commercialize their product candidates sooner than we commercialize our own; •      develop safer or more effective therapeutic drugs or preventive vaccines and other therapeutic products; •      implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing and capture some of our potential market share; •      establish superior intellectual property positions; •        discover technologies that may result in medical insights or breakthroughs, which render our drugs or vaccines obsolete, possibly before they generate any revenue; or •     adversely affect our ability to recruit patients for our clinical trials. there is no guarantee that our products or product candidates will be able to compete with potential future products being developed by our competitors. competitive products in our herpv program include valtrex (gsk) and famvir (novartis), which are small molecule drugs marketed for treatment of genital herpes. other companies are engaged in research and/or clinical development for vaccines for treatment of genital herpes including genocea and vical. aicuris gmbh is engaged in clinical research of a small molecule drug for treatment of genital herpes and has completed a phase 2 trial. we are aware of compounds that claim to be comparable to qs-21 stimulon that are being used in clinical trials. several other vaccine adjuvants are in development and could compete with qs-21 stimulon for inclusion in vaccines in development. these adjuvants include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, under development by pfizer, idera, colby, and dynavax, mf59 under development by novartis, ic31, under development by intercell, and mpl, under development by gsk. in the past, we have provided qs-21 stimulon to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. in at least one instance, it is possible that this material was used unlawfully to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of qs-21. in addition, companies such as adjuvance technologies, inc. csl limited, and novavax, inc., as well as academic institutions and manufacturers of saponin extracts, are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. these sources may be competitive with our ability to do future partnering and licensing deals with qs-21 stimulon. we are also aware of a third party that manufactures pre-clinical material purporting to be comparable to qs-21 stimulon. the claims being made by this third party may create marketplace confusion and have an adverse effect on the goodwill generated by us and our partners with respect to qs-21 stimulon. any diminution of this goodwill may have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize this technology, either alone or with a third party. 18 table of contents in competition with our prophage series product candidates, genentech markets avastin and eisai and arbor pharmaceuticals market gliadel, both for treatment of recurrent glioma. in addition, tvax biomedical and stemline therapeutics are developing immunotherapy candidates (tvi-brain-1 and sl-701, respectively) for recurrent glioma. schering corporation, a subsidiary of merck, markets temodar for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioma. other companies are developing vaccine candidates for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioma, such as innocell corp (immuncell-lc), immunocellular therapeutics (ict-107), northwest biotherapeutics (dc-vax), immatics (ima-950), activartis biotech (gbm-vax) and celldex (cdx-110). celldex is also currently developing a vaccine candidate for recurrent glioma. other companies may begin such development as well. as vaccines from our prophage series are potentially developed in other indications, they could face additional competition in those indications. in addition, and prior to regulatory approval, our prophage series vaccines and all of our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer therapies continue to accelerate. we have six preclinical checkpoint antibody programs that have been commenced by 4-ab. we are aware of several large companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological target as some of these programs, including bristol-myers squibb, which markets ipilimumab, an anti-ctla-4 antibody, and has an anti-pd1 antibody in development, medimmune, which has anti-ctla-4, ox-40 and pd1 antibodies in development, merck and curetech, which each has an anti-pdi antibody in development, and pfizer, which has an anti-ctla-4 antibody in development. our future growth depends on our ability to successfully identify, develop, acquire or in-license products and product candidates; otherwise, we may have limited growth opportunities. an important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing, acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our existing business. however, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: 19 table of contents • difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development, acquisition or in-licensed products or technologies; • incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products; • disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention; • higher than expected development, acquisition or in-license and integration costs; • exposure to unknown liabilities; • difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel; • inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; • difficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and • inability to successfully develop new products or clinical failure. we have limited resources to identify and execute the development, acquisition or in-licensing of products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. we may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations, and/or acquire, in-license, and/or advance new product candidates. these competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. moreover, we may devote resources to potential development, acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. failure to enter into and/or maintain significant licensing, distribution and/or collaboration agreements on favorable terms to us may hinder our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates and could increase our development timelines as well as our need to rely on other financing mechanisms, such as sales of debt or equity securities, to fund our operations. we have been engaged in efforts to enter into licensing, distribution and/or collaborative agreements with one or more pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to assist us with development and/or commercialization of our product candidates. if we are successful in entering into such agreements, we may not be able to negotiate agreements with economic terms similar to those negotiated by other companies. we may not, for example, obtain significant upfront payments, substantial royalty rates or milestones. if we fail to enter into any such agreements, our efforts to develop and/or commercialize our products or product candidates may be undermined. in addition, if we do not raise funds through any such agreements, we will need to rely on other financing mechanisms, such as sales of debt or equity securities, to fund our operations. such financing mechanisms, if available, may not be sufficient or timely enough to advance our programs forward in a meaningful way in the short-term. while we have been pursuing these business development efforts for several years, we have not entered into a substantial agreement relating to the potential development or commercialization of any of our prophage series vaccines other than the agreement with newvac giving them an exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell oncophage as well as pursue a development program in the russian federation and certain other cis countries. to date, the newvac arrangement has not provided substantial benefit to us, and there is no guarantee that it will. in addition, other companies may not be interested in pursuing patient-specific vaccines like our prophage series vaccines, and many other companies have been and may continue to be unwilling to commit to an agreement prior to receipt of additional clinical data, if at all. in addition, we would consider license and/or co-development opportunities to advance herpv and antibody candidates derived from the retrocyte display technology platform of 4-ab. however, collaborative partners or licensees may defer discussions until these assets are further developed, or they may not engage in such discussions on terms acceptable to us or at all. 20 table of contents because we rely on collaborators and licensees for the development and commercialization of most of our product candidate programs, these programs may not prove successful, and/or we may not receive significant payments from such parties. part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize a majority of our product candidates by continuing or entering into arrangements with academic, government, or corporate collaborators and licensees. our success depends on our ability to negotiate such agreements and on the success of the other parties in performing research, preclinical and clinical testing, completing regulatory applications, and commercializing product candidates. for example, the development of candidates from the prophage g series is currently dependent in a large part on the efforts of our institutional collaborators, such as the brain tumor research center at the university of california, san francisco, which has conducted or is in the process of conducting phase 2 clinical trials of prophage series vaccines g-100 and g-200 for the treatment of glioma and the alliance for clinical trials in oncology, a national cancer institute cooperative group, which is sponsoring a phase 2 clinical trial of g-200 in patients with surgically resectable recurrent glioma. when our licensees or third party collaborators sponsor clinical trials using our product candidates, we cannot control the timing or quality of such trials or related activities. in addition, substantially all product candidates containing qs-21 stimulon, other than herpv, depend on the success of our collaborative partners or licensees, and our relationships with these third parties. such product candidates depend on our collaborators and licensees successfully enrolling patients and completing clinical trials, being committed to dedicating the resources to advance these product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals, and successfully commercializing product candidates. we have granted newvac an exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell oncophage in the russian federation and certain other cis countries. newvac has faced challenges establishing manufacturing capabilities and securing government reimbursement, which has impacted its ability to commercialize the product in the licensed territory. newvac may terminate this agreement at any time without cause. we do not expect to receive financial or other benefits, if any, from our relationship with newvac or the sale of oncophage in the russian federation or cis countries. in addition, our research, development, and commercialization efforts with respect to antibody candidates from the retrocyte display technology platform include the participation of institutional and corporate collaborators. for example, 4-ab has collaborative arrangements with ludwig cancer research and brazil-based recepta biopharma sa, among others. if we are not able to preserve these arrangements, as well as advance additional collaborations, on terms favorable to us, this may diminish the value of the acquisition to us and could have a negative impact on our operations. development activities for our collaborative programs may fail to produce marketable products due to unsuccessful results or abandonment of these programs, failure to enter into future collaborations or license agreements, or the inability to manufacture product supply requirements for our collaborators and licensees. several of our agreements also require us to transfer important rights and regulatory compliance responsibilities to our collaborators and licensees. as a result of these collaborative agreements, we will not control the nature, timing, or cost of bringing these product candidates to market. our collaborators and licensees could choose not to devote resources to these arrangements or, under certain circumstances, may terminate these arrangements early. they may cease pursuing product candidates or elect to collaborate with different companies. in addition, these collaborators and licensees, outside of their arrangements with us, may develop technologies or products that are competitive with those that we are developing. from time to time, we may also become involved in disputes with our collaborators or licensees. such disputes could result in the incurrence of significant expense, or the termination of collaborations. we may be unable to fulfill all of our obligations to our collaborators, which may result in the termination of collaborations. as a result of these factors, our strategic collaborations may not yield revenue. furthermore, we may be unable to enter into new collaborations or enter into new collaborations on favorable terms. failure to generate significant revenue from collaborations would increase our need to fund our operations through sales of debt or equity securities and would negatively affect our business prospects. we are highly reliant on our chief executive officer and other members of our management team. in addition, we have limited internal resources and if we fail to recruit and/or retain the services of key employees and external consultants as needed, we may not be able to achieve our strategic and operational objectives. garo h. armen, ph.d., the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer, co-founded the company in 1994, and has been, and continues to be, integral to building our company and developing our technology. if dr. armen is unable or unwilling to continue his relationship with agenus, our business may be adversely impacted. effective december 1, 2005, we entered into an employment agreement with dr. armen. subject to the earlier termination as provided in the agreement, the agreement had an original term of one year and is automatically extended thereafter for successive terms of one year each, unless either party provides notice to the other at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the original or any extension term. dr. armen plays an important role in our day-to-day activities. we do not carry key employee insurance policies for dr. armen or any other employee. 21 table of contents we also rely on a small staff of highly trained and experienced senior management and scientific, administrative and operations personnel and consultants to conduct our business. reductions in our staffing levels have eliminated redundancies in key capabilities and skill sets among our full time staff and required us to rely more heavily on outside consultants and third parties. in addition, if in the future we need to perform sales, marketing and distribution functions for commercial and/or international operations, we will need to recruit experienced personnel and/or engage external consultants incurring significant expenditures.  reduction in expenses and resulting changes to our compensation and benefit programs have reduced the competitiveness of these programs and thereby increased employee retention risk. the competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and if we are not able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel and/or maintain positive relationships with our outside consultants, we may not be able to achieve our strategic and operational objectives. risks related to the acquisition we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition.   we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial legal, accounting, financial advisory and/or other costs and our management has devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the acquisition. these and other fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on our operating results. because 4-ab was acquired by us very recently, there may be aspects of its business or financial results that may not be well understood by us until we fully integrate 4-ab’s operations into our business. among other matters, although we do not believe that we will incur or assume any liabilities or obligations out of the ordinary course of business in connection with 4-ab’s business (other than approximately $1 million of obligations relating to transaction-related payments and certain 4-ab indebtedness totaling approximately $500,000), we may ultimately determine that unknown or unanticipated material liabilities exist. we may fail to realize the benefits we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition.           the long-term success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses of agenus and 4-ab. we may never realize these anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects. integrating operations will be complex and will require significant efforts and expenditures on the part of both agenus and 4-ab. employees might leave or be terminated. our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures. we might experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, and we might not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, including maintaining current collaboration relationships and advancing the development of the 4-ab technologies. we may experience difficulties reconciling 4-ab’s system of financial reporting, which has been based upon international financial reporting standards, or ifrs, for small and medium-sized entities, with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. moreover, assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings as a result of the acquisition may be inaccurate, and general industry and business conditions might deteriorate. if any of these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of agenus and 4-ab successfully or on a timely basis, or to develop the business opportunities that we expect to realize from the acquisition, the expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies expected to result from the acquisition, might not be met.         the issuance of shares of our common stock in the acquisition will dilute the interest held by our stockholders prior to the acquisition. we issued 3,334,079 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of 4-ab at closing having a fair market value of $10.1 million. in addition, we may be obligated in the future to pay certain contingent milestones payments, payable at our election in cash or shares of our common stock that may exceed $40 million. the issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock in connection with such contingent milestone payments would cause a reduction in the relative percentage interest of our current stockholders in the ownership of our common stock and could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock.  risks related to regulation of the biopharmaceutical industry  the drug development and approval process is uncertain, time-consuming, and expensive. clinical development, including preclinical testing and the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. as of december 31, 2013, we have spent approximately 19 22 table of contents years and $303.5 million on our research and development program in heat shock proteins for cancer. it also can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. we must provide regulatory authorities with manufacturing, product characterization, and preclinical and clinical data demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale. it may take us many years to complete our testing, and failure can occur at any stage of testing. interim results of preclinical studies or clinical trials do not necessarily predict their final results, and acceptable results in early studies might not be seen in later studies. any preclinical or clinical test may fail to produce results satisfactory to regulatory authorities for many reasons, including but not limited to insufficient product characterization, poor study structure conduct or statistical analysis planning, failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients or failure to prospectively identify the most appropriate patient eligibility criteria, and collectability of data. preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial, adverse medical events during a clinical trial, or safety issues resulting from products of the same class of drug could require a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated or cause a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful. we or the fda, other regulatory agencies, or an institutional review board may suspend or terminate human clinical trials at any time on various grounds. the timing and success of a clinical trial is dependent on obtaining and maintaining sufficient cash resources, successful production of clinical trial material, enrolling sufficient patients in a timely manner, avoiding serious or significant adverse patient reactions, and demonstrating efficacy of the product candidate in order to support a favorable risk versus benefit profile, among other considerations. the timing and success of our clinical trials, in particular, are also dependent on clinical sites and regulatory authorities accepting each trial's protocol, statistical analysis plan, product characterization tests, and clinical data. in addition, regulatory authorities may request additional information or data that is not readily available. delays in our ability to respond to such requests would delay, and failure to adequately address concerns would prevent, our commercialization efforts. we have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, delays in initiating trial sites and enrolling patients into our clinical trials. future enrollment delays will postpone the dates by which we expect to complete the impacted trials and the potential receipt of regulatory approval. there is no guarantee we will successfully initiate and/or complete our clinical trials. delays or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for our product candidates may: •     adversely affect the marketing of any products we or our licensees or collaborators develop; •      impose significant additional costs on us or our licensees or collaborators; •      diminish any competitive advantages that we or our licensees or collaborators may attain; •      limit our ability to receive royalties and generate revenue and profits; and •      adversely affect our business prospects and ability to obtain financing. delays or failures in our receiving regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner may result in us having to incur additional development expense and subject us to having to secure additional financing. as a result, we may not be able to commercialize them in the time frame anticipated, and our business will suffer. even if we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, such product approvals could be subject to restrictions or withdrawals. regulatory requirements are subject to change. regulatory authorities generally approve products for particular indications. if an approval is for a limited indication, this limitation reduces the size of the potential market for that product. product approvals, once granted, are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by regulatory authorities. our operations and practices are subject to regulation and scrutiny by the united states government, as well as governments of any other countries in which we do business or conduct activities. later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues, and/or failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws, knowingly or unknowingly, can result in various adverse consequences, including, among other things, possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications, complete withdrawal of a marketing application, and/or criminal prosecution, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and/or exclusion from government health care programs. such regulatory enforcement could have a direct and negative impact on the product for which approval is granted, but also could have a negative impact on the approval of any pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications. because we are a company operating in a highly regulated industry, regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us in connection with our, or our licensees or collaborators, business and marketing activities for various reasons. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. 23 table of contents from time to time, new legislation is passed into law that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the fda and other foreign health authorities. additionally, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by health agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. it is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or whether regulations, guidance, or interpretations will change, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the “aca”), enacted in march 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. with regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, aca is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the medicare d program. we expect both government and private health plans to continue to require healthcare providers, including healthcare providers that may one day purchase our products, to contain costs and demonstrate the value of the therapies they provide. new data from our research and development activities, and/or resource considerations could modify our strategy and result in the need to adjust our projections of timelines and costs of programs. because we are focused on novel technologies, our research and development activities, including our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, involve the ongoing discovery of new facts and the generation of new data, based on which we determine next steps for a relevant program. these developments can occur with varying frequency and constitute the basis on which our business is conducted. we need to make determinations on an ongoing basis as to which of these facts or data will influence timelines and costs of programs. we may not always be able to make such judgments accurately, which may increase the costs we incur attempting to commercialize our product candidates. we monitor the likelihood of success of our initiatives and we may need to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be commercially feasible, due to our limited resources. we may need to successfully address a number of technological challenges in order to complete development of our product candidates. moreover, these product candidates may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approvals or prevent or limit commercial use. risks related to intellectual property rights  if we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed. issued patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. in addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology companies. the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not allow us to protect our inventions with patents to the same extent as the laws of the united states. because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patents or patent applications. as a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. therefore, the enforceability and scope of our patents in the united states and in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. we may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection from our pending patent applications, from those we may file in the future, or from those we may license from third parties. moreover, even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives. furthermore, the product development timeline for biotechnology products is lengthy and it is possible that our issued patents covering our product candidates in the united states and other jurisdictions may expire prior to commercial launch. in addition, because our patent on qs-21 stimulon composition of matter has already expired, our patent rights are limited to protecting certain combinations of qs-21 stimulon with other adjuvants or formulations of qs-21 stimulon with other agents, such as excipients that improve performance of the compound. however, there is no guarantee that a third party would necessarily choose to use qs-21 stimulon in combination with such adjuvants or formulate it with the other agents covered by our patents. we are aware of other companies that claim to produce material comparable to qs-21 stimulon. at least one other party has also developed derivatives of qs-21 that have shown biological activity. our strategy depends on our ability to identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. this process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. despite our efforts to 24 table of contents protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. the issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. in addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology. the patent landscape in the field of therapeutic antibody development, manufacture and commercialization is crowded. for example, we are aware of third party patents directed to methods for identifying and producing therapeutic antibodies, we are also aware of third party patents directed to antibodies to numerous targets for which we also seek to identify, develop, and commercialize antibodies, including without limitation ctla-4, pd-1, gitr, ox40, tim-3, and lag-3. for example, some patents claim antibodies based on competitive binding with existing antibodies, some claim antibodies based on specifying sequence or other structural information, and some claim various methods of discovery, production, or use of such antibodies. these or other third party patents could impinge on or foreclose our freedom to operate in relation to our technology platforms, including retrocyte display, as well as to development and commercialization of antibodies identified by us as therapeutic candidates. as we discover and develop our candidate antibodies, we will continue to conduct analyses of these third party patents to determine whether we believe we might infringe them, and if so, whether they would be likely to be deemed valid and enforceable if challenged. if we determine that a license for a given patent or family of patents is necessary or desirable, there can be no guarantee that a license would be available on favorable terms, or at all. inability to obtain a license on favorable terms, should such a license be determined to be necessary or desirable, could, without limitation, result in increased costs to design around the third party patents, delay product launch, or result in cancellation of the affected program or cessation of use of the affected technology. third parties may also seek to market biosimilar versions of any approved products. alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. in these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. in any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable. even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. we have exclusive rights to approximately 60 issued united states patents and approximately 99 issued foreign patents. we also have exclusive rights to approximately 13 pending united states patent applications and approximately 43 pending foreign patent applications. however, our patents may not protect us against our competitors. our patent positions, and those of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. the standards which the united states patent and trademark office, or uspto, uses to grant patents, and the standards which courts use to interpret patents, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. consequently, the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them, and they are challenged, is uncertain. in addition, the type and extent of patent claims that will be issued to us in the future is uncertain. any patents that are issued may not contain claims that permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology. the issued patents that cover the prophage series vaccines expire at various dates between 2015 and 2024. the issued patents related to herpv expire at various dates between 2014 and 2029. our patent to purified qs-21 stimulon expired in 2008. additional protection for qs-21 stimulon in combination with other agents is provided by our other issued patents which expire between 2017 and 2022. we continue to explore means of extending the life cycle of our patent portfolio. through our acquisition of 4-ab, we also own a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of 4-ab’s technology platforms. in particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to retrocyte display®, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully human monoclonal antibodies.  this patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2030.  in addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we intend to seek patent protection for newly-identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. we can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including these newly acquired patents, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including these newly acquired patent applications, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents. the patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. the standards which the uspto and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. there is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary information to the same extent as the laws of the united states, and many companies have 25 table of contents encountered significant problems and costs in protecting their proprietary information in these foreign countries. outside the united states, patent protection must be sought in individual jurisdictions, further adding to the cost and uncertainty of obtaining adequate patent protection outside of the united states. accordingly, we cannot predict whether additional patents protecting our technology will issue in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions, or whether any patents that do issue will have claims of adequate scope to provide competitive advantage. moreover, we cannot predict whether third parties will be able to successfully obtain claims or the breadth of such claims. the allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, and/or reexamination proceedings, the risk of infringement litigation, and the vulnerability of the claims to challenge. on the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims does not eliminate the potential for adversarial proceedings, and may fail to provide a competitive advantage. our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us with any competitive advantage. our patent on qs-21 stimulon composition of matter has expired and we rely primarily on unpatented technology and know-how to protect our rights to qs-21 stimulon. our patent on qs-21 stimulon composition of matter has expired, and our patent rights are limited to protecting certain combinations of qs-21 stimulon with other adjuvants or formulations of qs-21 stimulon with other agents. although our licenses also rely on unpatented technology, know-how, and confidential information, these intellectual property rights may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions and, we may not be able to collect anticipated revenue from our licensees. any such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. even after they have been issued, our patents and any patents which we license may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. if our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited or will expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. the following are examples of litigation and other adversarial proceedings or disputes that we could become a party to involving our patents or patents licensed to us:   • we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights; • third parties may initiate litigation or other proceedings seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their product or technology does not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us; • third parties may initiate opposition proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, or reexamination proceedings challenging the validity or scope of our patent rights, requiring us or our collaborators and/or licensors to participate in such proceedings to defend the validity and scope of our patents; • there may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents currently identified as being owned by or licensed to us; • the uspto may initiate an interference or derivation proceeding between patents or patent applications owned by or licensed to us and those of our competitors, requiring us or our collaborators and/or licensors to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights; or • third parties may seek approval to market biosimilar versions of our future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. these lawsuits and proceedings would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. there is a risk that a court or administrative body could decide that our patents are invalid or not infringed by a third party’s activities, or that the scope of certain issued claims must be further limited. an adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our own patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against these or other competitors, affect our ability to receive royalties or other licensing consideration from our licensees, and may curtail or 26 table of contents preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using and selling similar or competitive products. any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. for example:   • others may be able to develop a platform that is similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents; • others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents; • we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by patents or pending patent applications; • we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; • any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable; or • we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable. our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. our success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our future approved products or impair our competitive position. in particular, as a result of the acquisition, we now have six preclinical checkpoint antibody programs, and the patent landscape around the discovery, development, manufacture and commercial use of therapeutic antibodies is crowded. patents that we may ultimately be found to infringe could be issued to third parties. third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing product candidates using our technology. our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our failure to maintain a license to any technology that we require may also materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, we would be exposed to a threat of litigation. in the biopharmaceutical industry, significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights have become commonplace. the types of situations in which we may become a party to such litigation or proceedings include:   • we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties seeking to invalidate the patents held by those third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or processes do not infringe those third parties’ patents; • if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us or our licensors, we or our licensors may be required to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights and potentially provide a third party with a dominant patent position; • if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings; and • if a license to necessary technology is terminated, the licensor may initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights and/or that we breached our obligations under the license agreement, and we and our collaborators would need to defend against such proceedings. these lawsuits would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our management and scientific personnel. there is a risk that a court would decide that we or our collaborators are infringing the third party’s patents 27 table of contents and would order us or our collaborators to stop the activities covered by the patents. in that event, we or our collaborators may not have a viable alternative to the technology protected by the patent and may need to halt work on the affected product candidate or cease commercialization of an approved product. in addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our collaborators to pay the other party damages. an adverse outcome in any litigation or other proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties. we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. the biopharmaceutical industry has produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. the coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform or predictable. if we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. proving invalidity is difficult. for example, in the united states, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management’s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. patent litigation is costly and time consuming. we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. in addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates. the cost of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. if we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. we are currently party to various intellectual property license agreements. these license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements may impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. these licenses typically include an obligation to pay an upfront payment, yearly maintenance payments and royalties on sales. if we fail to comply with our obligations under the licenses, the licensors may have the right to terminate their respective license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the agreements. termination of the license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business. if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected. in addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, and other proprietary information. to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationships with us. these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. our agreements with employees and our personnel policies also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. however, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. thus, despite such agreement, such inventions may become assigned to third parties. in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. to the extent that an individual who is not obligated to assign rights in intellectual property to us is rightfully an inventor of intellectual property, we may need to obtain an assignment or a license to that intellectual property from that individual, or a third party or from that individual’s assignee. such assignment or license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 28 table of contents adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information. the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. in addition, others may independently discover or develop our trade secrets and proprietary information, and the existence of our own trade secrets affords no protection against such independent discovery. as is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously or concurrently employed at research institutions and/or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these employees, even those related to one or more of our product candidates, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to the uspto and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications. we have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees when due. additionally, the uspto and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. however, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. if such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are responsible for the payment of patent fees for patent rights that we have licensed from other parties. if any licensor of these patents does not itself elect to make these payments, and we fail to do so, we may be liable to the licensor for any costs and consequences of any resulting loss of patent rights. risks related to litigation we may face litigation that could result in substantial damages and may divert management's time and attention from our business. we may currently be a party, or may become a party, to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty. furthermore, litigation consumes both cash and management attention. we maintain property and general commercial insurance coverage as well as errors and omissions and directors and officers insurance policies. this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us for future claims. we are also exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations, to provide accurate information to the fda, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. in particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. in addition, during the course of our operations, our directors, executives and employees may have access to material, nonpublic information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. we may not be able to prevent a director, executive or employee from trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material, nonpublic information. if a director, executive or employee was to be investigated, or an action was to be brought against a director, executive or employee for insider trading, 29 table of contents it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price. such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money, and divert attention of our management team. product liability and other claims against us may reduce demand for our products and/or result in substantial damages. we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to testing our product candidates in human clinical trials and commercial sales of oncophage in russia, and may face even greater risks if we sell our other product candidates commercially. an individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. product liability claims may result in: •      decreased demand for our product candidates; •     regulatory investigations; •      injury to our reputation; •     withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers; •      costs of related litigation; and •     substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs. we manufacture the prophage series vaccines from a patient's cancer cells, and medical professionals must inject the vaccines into the same patient from which they were manufactured. a patient may sue us if a hospital, a shipping company, or we fail to receive the removed cancer tissue or deliver that patient's vaccine. we anticipate that the logistics of shipping will become more complex if the number of patients we treat increases and that shipments of tumor and/or vaccines may be lost, delayed, or damaged. additionally, complexities unique to the logistics of commercial products may delay shipments and limit our ability to move commercial product in an efficient manner without incident. we do not have any other insurance that covers loss of or damage to the prophage series vaccines or tumor material, and we do not know whether such insurance will be available to us at a reasonable price or at all. we have limited product liability coverage for use of our product candidates. our product liability policy provides $10.0 million aggregate coverage and $10.0 million per occurrence coverage. this limited insurance coverage may be insufficient to fully cover us for future claims. we are also subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including but not limited to, federal, state and local wage and hour, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination and whistle-blowing. any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects. if we do not comply with environmental laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs and potential disruption to our business. we use or may use hazardous, infectious, and radioactive materials, and recombinant dna in our operations, which have the potential of being harmful to human health and safety or the environment. we store these hazardous (flammable, corrosive, toxic), infectious, and radioactive materials, and various wastes resulting from their use, at our facilities pending use and ultimate disposal. we are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing use, generation, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials. we may incur significant costs complying with both current and future environmental health and safety laws and regulations. in particular, we are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration, the environmental protection agency, the drug enforcement agency, the department of transportation, the centers for disease control and prevention, the national institutes of health, the international air transportation association, and various state and local agencies. at any time, one or more of the aforementioned agencies could adopt regulations that may affect our operations. we are also subject to regulation under the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation development programs. although we believe that our current procedures and programs for handling, storage, and disposal of these materials comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidents involving contamination from these materials. although we have a workers' compensation liability policy, we could be held liable for resulting damages in the event of an accident or accidental release, and such damages could be substantially in excess of any available insurance coverage and could substantially disrupt our business. 30 table of contents risks related to our common stock our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market, which could affect its market price and liquidity. our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market (“nasdaq”) under the symbol “agen.” in the event that we fail to maintain compliance with the applicable listing requirements, our common stock could become subject to delisting from nasdaq. although we are currently in compliance with all of the listing standards for listing on nasdaq, we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to be in compliance in the future. we have been non-compliant with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule 5550(a)(2) three times since our move to the nasdaq capital market in april 2009. provisions in our organizational documents could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace our current management. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board and removal of directors only for cause. accordingly, stockholders may elect only a minority of our board at any annual meeting, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in management. in addition, under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock and determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. our issuance of additional preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby effect a change in the composition of our board of directors. our certificate of incorporation also provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent. our bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations and permit only our president or a majority of the board of directors to call a special stockholder meeting. these provisions may have the effect of preventing or hindering attempts by our stockholders to replace our current management. in addition, delaware law prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction. our board of directors may use this provision to prevent changes in our management. also, under applicable delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future. the first right to negotiate provision contained in our agreement with one of our licensees could hinder or delay a change of control of our company or the sale of certain of our assets we have entered into a first right to negotiate and amendment agreement with gsk that affords gsk, one of our licensees, a first right to negotiate with us in the event we determine to initiate a process to effect a change of control of our company with, or to sell certain of our assets to, an unaffiliated third party or in the event that a third party commences an unsolicited tender offer seeking a change of control of our company. in such event, we must provide gsk a period of time to determine whether it wishes to negotiate the terms of such a transaction with us. if gsk affirmatively so elects, we are required to negotiate with gsk in good faith towards effecting a transaction of that nature for a specified period. during the negotiation period, we are obligated not to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party that would preclude us from negotiating and/or executing a definitive agreement with gsk. if gsk determines not to negotiate with us or we are unable to come to an agreement with gsk during this period, we may enter into the specified change of control or sale transaction within the following 12 months, provided that such a transaction is not on terms in the aggregate that are materially less favorable to us and our stockholders (as determined by our board of directors, in its reasonable discretion) than terms last offered to us by gsk in a binding written proposal during the negotiation period. the first right to negotiate terminates on march 2, 2017. although gsk's first right to negotiate does not compel us to enter into a transaction with gsk nor prevent us from negotiating with or entering into a transaction with a third party, the first right to negotiate could inhibit a third party from engaging in discussions with us concerning such a transaction or delay our ability to effect such a transaction with a third party. our stock has historically had low trading volume, and its public trading price has been volatile. between our initial public offering on february 4, 2000 and december 31, 2013, and for the year ended december 31, 2013, the closing price of our common stock has fluctuated between $1.80 and $315.78 per share and $2.40 and $4.93 per share, respectively. the average daily trading volume for the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately 367,000 shares. the market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. in addition to general market volatility, many factors may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our stock, including: 31 table of contents • continuing operating losses, which we expect over the next several years as we continue our development activities; • announcements of decisions made by public officials; • results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; • announcements of new collaboration agreements with strategic partners or developments by our existing collaborative partners; • announcements of technological innovations, new commercial products, failures of products, or progress toward commercialization by our competitors or peers; • failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition; • developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent and litigation matters; • publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to product candidates under development; • quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; • variations in the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs; • additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel; • conditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries; • other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; • changes in accounting principles; • general economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies; and • sales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a significant decline in the market price of its securities. this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally experience significant stock price volatility. the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. the sale of a significant number of shares could cause the market price of our stock to decline. the sale by us or the resale by stockholders of a significant number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. as of december 31, 2013, we had approximately 36,348,000 shares of common stock outstanding. all of these shares are eligible for sale on nasdaq, although certain of the shares are subject to sales volume and other limitations. we have filed registration statements to permit the sale of approximately 8,200,000 shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans. we have also filed registration statements to permit the sale of approximately 167,000 shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, to permit the sale of 225,000 shares of common stock under our directors' deferred compensation plan, to permit the sale of approximately 8,274,000 shares of common stock pursuant to various private placement agreements and to permit the sale of approximately 10,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to our at market issuance sales agreement. as of december 31, 2013, an aggregate of 12.9 million of these shares remain available for sale. in addition, we have agreed to file a registration statement on form s-3 to permit the sale of the shares of our common stock that were issued in connection with the acquisition not later than 90 days after the acquisition. the market price of our common stock may decrease based on the expectation of such sales. as of december 31, 2013, warrants to purchase approximately 3,280,000 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price per share of $11.28 were outstanding. as of december 31, 2013, options to purchase 4,163,100 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price per share of $5.72 were outstanding. these options are subject to vesting that occurs over a period of up to four years following the date of grant. as of december 31, 2013 we have 147,274 nonvested shares outstanding. 32 table of contents we may issue additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. furthermore, substantially all shares of common stock for which our outstanding stock options or warrants are exercisable are, once they have been purchased, eligible for immediate sale in the public market. the issuance of additional common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock units, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or the exercise of stock options or warrants would dilute existing investors and could adversely affect the price of our securities. in addition, such securities may have rights senior to the rights of securities held by existing investors. failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and to comply with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our common stock. the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and rules adopted by the sec and nasdaq have resulted in significant costs to us. in particular, our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations regarding the required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm's audit of internal control over financial reporting, have required commitments of significant management time. we expect these commitments to continue. our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15 of the exchange act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. gaap. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all deficiencies or weaknesses in our financial reporting. while our management has concluded that there were no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2013, our procedures are subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or as a result of a deterioration in compliance with such procedures. no assurance is given that our procedures and processes for detecting weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will be effective. we anticipate additional commitments of management time to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting of the operations of 4-ab complies with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. prior to the acquisition, 4-ab was a privately held company organized under the laws of switzerland and, as such, it has not been subject to financial reporting requirements applicable to public companies and was not required to prepare and publish audited financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. accordingly, our efforts to ensure that our internal control over the financial reporting of the operations of 4-ab will cause us to incur significant additional costs. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, are creating uncertainty for companies. laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in some cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs caused by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, our reputation may be harmed and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the sec. any such action could adversely affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock. if our stockholders do not approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, our ability to provide adequate incentives to our employees and competitively pursue future opportunities could be materially adversely effected. in february 2014 we raised approximately $56.0 million in a public offering by issuing approximately 22.2 million shares of our common stock. in order to maximize the benefit of this financing for us and in response to high investor demand, we had to deplete all remaining authorized shares available for issuance under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. furthermore, we opted to unreserve shares otherwise available for issuance under our 2009 equity incentive plan. as a result, we are currently unable to offer equity incentives under the 2009 equity incentive plan to new or existing employees, including those employees who joined us through the acquisition. the unavailability of authorized shares of common stock places us in a competitive disadvantage since our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and to utilize non-cash compensation for other legitimate corporate business purposes, is compromised. our board of directors has approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 140,000,000. we intend to submit the amendment to our stockholders for approval at our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders. if stockholder approval is not received for this amendment, we believe it will compromise our ability to provide incentives to our employees and to competitively pursue future business and financial endeavors with common stock consideration, and this could have an adverse effect on our business. 33 table of contents item 1b. unresolved
