item 1a.           risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in forward-looking statements we make about our business. deterioration of and extreme volatility in general economic conditions and consumer spending conditions could result in a decline in the number of people willing to purchase our premium travel products. demand for our products and services may be significantly affected by the general level of economic activity, level of discretionary spending and employment levels in the united states and key international markets. therefore, global economic downturns or a recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, impact cash flows and our results of operations. currently, the united states and other markets are facing these conditions which have impacted demand in the travel industry, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. we expect these conditions will continue to impact our operations and profitability for the foreseeable future. a decline in the travel industry could adversely affect our results of operations. our results of operations depend upon factors affecting the travel industry in general. our earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect domestic and international air travel and availability of lodging and transportation. a number of factors, including a rise in fuel prices or other travel costs, which if passed along later in the year could decrease our ability to pass these costs onto our participants, reduction of airline capacity causing prices to increase, excessive inflation, currency fluctuations within the global market, the strength of the dollar, foreign taxation changes, extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety could result in a temporary or longer-term overall decline in demand for our programs. if we are ineffective in our marketing efforts or are unable to obtain quality leads or prospects, our future growth and profitability could be impacted. performance in our travel programs is substantially reliant on our ability to attract and retain travelers through our direct and indirect marketing efforts. the effectiveness of marketing efforts is highly dependent on our ability to identify and obtain productive lead sources, execute direct mail strategies, secure attendance and conversion at our local informational meetings, increase our digital presence, including the number of website visitors and unique users, and develop our brands. failure or underperformance of our marketing efforts, including changes in the direct-mail environment and the company’s reputation with teachers and potential participants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. such changes in the direct-mail environment could include, but are not limited to, new or different regulatory schemes or changes in costs or services by the united states postal service. business interruption due to natural occurrences, international political or terrorist activities and threats thereof, and other world events or incidents affecting the health, safety, security and/or program satisfaction of individuals without adequate insurance coverage or preparedness could have an adverse effect on our profitability. our operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business internationally, as most of our travel programs are conducted outside of the united states. demand for our travel programs may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, extreme flooding, and epidemics or other disease outbreaks such as influenza in geographic regions in which we conduct travel programs. in the event potential risks, such as war, u.s. military deployments, international and domestic terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights occur, they may impact our customers willingness to travel to these destinations or our ability to deliver planned programs. table of contents -7-   the consequences of these types of events are unpredictable and the occurrence of any of the events described above, or other unforeseen developments in one or more of the regions in which we travel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire, retain, and/or travel enrollments, which would substantially impact profitability, cash flows, and results of operations. historically, we have experienced increased cancellations for our travel programs during such times and if these business interruptions occur during the peak travel season, the impact can be magnified. if we are unable to use our established brands such as the “people to people” name, or if the value of our name, image or brand diminishes, our ability in attracting future travelers could be significantly impacted and our business would be harmed. our brand names and trademarks are integral to our marketing efforts.  we have registered or applied for a variety of service and trademarks including, but not limited to, the names “people to people ambassador programs,” “people to people student ambassador programs,” “people to people sports ambassador programs,” “people to people citizen ambassador programs,” “people to people leadership programs,” “bookrags” and “society for global citizens.” in addition, we have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to use the “people to people” and “discovery education” service, trademarks and logos for use in our marketing. our agreements with people to people international, currently scheduled to expire in 2020, give us the exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for kindergarten through high school students using the people to people name, and the non-exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for professionals, college students and athletes using the people to people name. if our agreement with people to people international were terminated or if we were unable to use the branded name to market new programs or destinations, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire participants for our programs and consequently affect our results of operations. similarly, if our relationship with people to people international is disrupted or is adversely impacted because people to people international experiences interruption, delay or ceases operations in the future for any reason, our business could be harmed. in addition, our ability to attract and enroll new delegates to travel with us is dependent on the value of the brands we associate with and our reputation with potential customers. if negative news coverage or other negative public relation matters occur in the student travel industry or specifically related to our company, our business could experience adverse effects impacting our volume and profitability. our dependence on travel suppliers could delay the delivery of our products and services, which would impact our reputation and could reduce our profitability. we are dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services. travel suppliers include airlines, hotels, bus lines, overseas coordinators and other participants in the travel industry. consistent with industry practices, we currently have no long-term agreements with travel suppliers that obligate such suppliers to sell services or products through us on an ongoing basis. therefore, the travel suppliers generally can cancel or modify their agreements with us upon relatively short notice. in addition, any decline in the quality of travel products and services provided by these suppliers, or a perception by our participants of such a decline, could adversely affect our reputation and profitability. in addition, the loss of contracts, changes in our pricing agreements or commission arrangements, more restricted access to travel suppliers’ products and services, less favorable public opinion of certain travel suppliers, or loss of deposits with travel suppliers that could go bankrupt, could all have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the amount we pay for services received from foreign vendors and could positively or negatively affect our gross margin results. over 90 percent of our travel is internationally based and many of our arrangements with our foreign-based suppliers require payment to be made in foreign currencies. increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to foreign currencies have the effect of impacting the cost of the services to be provided.  since late 1993, we generally have entered into forward contracts and other financial instruments with less than two years' maturity to help manage program costs and hedge against foreign currency valuation changes. while the ability to utilize forward contracts for the delivery of foreign currencies can mitigate the effect on program costs and foreign currency exchange fluctuations, there can be no assurance that program costs will not be significantly impacted in future periods. there can also be no assurance our hedging strategy will mitigate longer-term foreign exchange valuation trends. depending on the strength of the u.s. dollar at the time the forward contracts and options are entered into, its strength throughout the contracted period, and the accuracy of our projected enrollment volume, we could experience over-hedged positions, which may result in a gain or loss that must be recognized immediately in our consolidated financial statements. table of contents -8-     significant fluctuations in financial results from quarter to quarter related to the seasonality of our business and the timing differences of marketing expenses as compared to corresponding revenue could impact investor confidence and cause potential share price volatility.   our business is highly seasonal and we anticipate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. the majority of our travel programs and the associated revenues are delivered in june and july of each year. a small number of travel programs are delivered throughout the rest of the year as well as the majority of our internet research and advertising sales that occur primarily during the traditional school year. sales and marketing costs are highest in the third and fourth quarters and typically occur nine to twelve months in advance of the associated revenue, mostly recognized during the second and third quarters. although historically revenue recognized has offset the operating losses incurred during the rest of the year, the long lead time for this revenue, creates a situation where individual quarter or annual operating results may not match expectations of public market analysts and investors. depending on their understanding of this aspect of our business, history with our company, and confidence in forthcoming business plans, our share price could be materially and adversely affected. the market price of our common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations due to specific market changes such as speculation in the press or investment community, actions by institutional shareholders, general market conditions, limited shares of common stock available for trading.   we are exposed to impairment risk of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.   financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company’s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate, and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization. during times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend.   the assessment for possible impairment requires us to make judgments including estimating future cash flows that are dependent upon internal forecasts, estimating the long-term rate of growth for our business, and estimating the useful life over which our cash flows will occur. while we have not previously recorded any impairment losses for goodwill or intangible assets, continued adverse market conditions could impact the fair value of our reporting units that could result in impairments of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. changes in our estimates and assumptions as they relate to valuation of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets could affect, potentially materially, our financial condition or results of operations in the future.   table of contents -9-   the travel industry and specifically the educational segment within the travel industry are highly competitive.  if we are unable to compete effectively in these markets, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected. the travel industry in general and the educational segment of the travel industry are highly competitive and have relatively low barriers to entry. we compete with other companies that provide similar educational travel programs, professional travel and adult continuing education programs, activity camps and summer camps, as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers with the assistance of local travel agents. people to people, under the terms of its agreement with us, reserves the right to offer programs to college students for studies abroad and to grant to other individuals or entities the right to use the people to people name in connection with people to people’s professional education and sports programs. certain organizations engaged in the travel business could have substantially greater brand-name recognition and financial, marketing and sales resources than we do, and may offer an educational travel experience at a lower price. there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us in the future. the online research and advertising market is intensely competitive and changes rapidly.  if we are unable to project trends and develop new sales opportunities to effectively compete in this space, our ability to maintain historical growth trends could be impacted. we face significant competition from a wide variety of content and media web properties with companies throughout the world. content and advertising on the internet are intensely competitive and have been rapidly evolving with converging technologies. we compete with many larger web properties that have larger staff dedicated towards selling and advertising and have more traffic to offer potential advertisers. we believe that the internet offers a more attractive and measurable advertising option than traditional off-line media including television, radio, billboard, magazine, and newspaper, and anticipate that this competition will increase over time as online usage continues to grow. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, and the failure to compete successfully may have a significant adverse effect on our ability for future growth as well as on our results of operations and future cash flows. litigation or other claims of liability may subject us to significant costs, judgments, fines and penalties that may not be covered by or may be in excess of available insurance coverage, may divert management’s attention and resources from our business, and may result in adverse publicity. due to the nature of our business and being a publicly held company, we may be subject to liability claims arising out of perceived wrong doing related to management’s decisions, securities claims, governmental investigations, business operations, accidents or disasters causing injury to delegates on our programs, including claims for serious personal injury or death. we maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for risks arising from the normal course of our business, including, but not limited to, professional and general liability insurance. there is no assurance that the insurance maintained by us will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims, that such insurance will cover a claim or loss, continue to be available in the future, or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss. further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future. successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims, or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and cash flows. in addition to impact on profitability, liability claims asserted against us can also divert management’s attention and company resources to participation in the litigation process and defense of these asserted claims. lastly, claims asserted against us could adversely affect the public’s perception of us. see note 9, “commitments and contingencies,” to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for a description of the recent claims that have been made against us. table of contents -10-   we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel with industry specific knowledge. our performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel that have experience pertinent to success in the educational travel industry. the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have an adverse effect on our business operations, along with our ability to grow our business, generate innovative ideas, remain strategic, and recruit and maintain highly functional teams. our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel. our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations. government regulation and taxation may adversely affect our business or the travel industry and thus increase our operating expenses. many travel suppliers, particularly airlines, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign governments. in addition, the travel industry is subject to certain seller of travel laws and special taxes by federal, state, local and foreign governments, including but not limited to hotel bed taxes, car rental taxes, airline excise taxes, airport taxes and fees and income and business taxes. new or different regulatory schemes, increasing regulatory scrutiny on third party marketing and licensing arrangements, more rigorous privacy laws, or changes in tax policy could have an adverse impact on key parts of our business or the travel industry in general and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights. substantially all of our publications in the bookrags segment are protected by copyright, held either in our name, in the name of the author of the work, or in the name of the sponsoring professional society. such copyrights protect our exclusive right to publish the work in the united states and in many countries abroad for specified periods. our ability to obtain and continue to obtain access to existing and new content, as well as our ability to continue to achieve expected results depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. our results may be adversely affected by lack of adequate legal or technological protections for our intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets that we operate in. we are exposed to concentration of credit risk that could affect our results of operations. a larger percentage of our balance sheet consists of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities which are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. although we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions, at times, such balances may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit or may be on deposit at institutions which are not covered by this insurance. if such institutions were to become insolvent while holding our cash, cash equivalents or available-for-sale securities in excess of the insurance limit, we could suffer losses or it could be necessary to obtain credit financing to operate our travel programs. there is no assurance that we could respond timely enough to avoid losses and a swift, material change in these markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate. based on current circumstances, we plan to continue our current dividend practices. however, you should be aware that these practices are subject to change due to a variety of factors, including the following: (i) we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position; (ii) decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend practices at any time and for any reason; (iii) the effects of changes to laws or regulations which impact our ability to pay dividends; (iv) the amount of dividends that we may distribute to our stockholders may be limited by the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur; and (v) the effects of downturns in the domestic and global economies. our stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends.  if we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investment in our common stock will only occur if our stock price appreciates. table of contents -11-   failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulatory standards or maintain the security of internal or customer data, including payment card industry (pci) data, could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to substantial fines and penalties. our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers, that are processed, summarized and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers. we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. the integrity and protection of all customer, employee, and company data is critical to us.  we devote substantial time and incur additional costs to ensure proper compliance and safe guarding of such data. our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and comply with the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy which is increasingly demanding. a theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer personal or credit card information, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant remedial and other costs, fines and litigation. we could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise. we face the risk of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.  we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our it networks and related systems. although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could: disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, which others could use to compete against us; require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; subject us to claims for contract breach and damages; or damage our reputation, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. table of contents -12-     item 1b.
