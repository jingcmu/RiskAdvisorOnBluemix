item 1a.    risk factors.         our business involves certain risks and uncertainties. in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be unknown to us and some of which we may deem immaterial. if one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. risks related to our operations coal prices are subject to change and a substantial or extended decline in prices could materially and adversely affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.         our profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon the prices we receive for our coal. the contract prices we may receive in the future for coal depend upon factors beyond our control, including the following:  the domestic and foreign supply and demand for coal;  the quantity and quality of coal available from competitors;  competition for production of electricity from non-coal sources, including the price and availability of alternative fuels;  domestic air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants and the ability of coal-fueled power plants to meet these standards by installing scrubbers or other means;  adverse weather, climatic or other natural conditions, including natural disasters;  domestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns;  legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes or changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal industry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions or providing for increased funding and incentives for alternative energy sources;  the proximity to, capacity of and cost of transportation and port facilities; and  market price fluctuations for sulfur dioxide emission allowances.         a substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our future coal sales contracts could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our profitability and the value of our coal reserves. our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production levels and could materially and adversely affect our profitability.         we mine coal at underground and surface mining operations. certain factors beyond our control, including those listed below, could disrupt our coal mining operations, adversely affect production and shipments and increase our operating costs:  poor mining conditions resulting from geological, hydrologic or other conditions that may cause instability of highwalls or spoil piles or cause damage to nearby infrastructure or mine personnel;  a major incident at the mine site that causes all or part of the operations of the mine to cease for some period of time;  mining, processing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems; 37 table of contents  adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding and other natural events affecting operations, transportation or customers;  unexpected or accidental surface subsidence from underground mining;  accidental mine water discharges, fires, explosions or similar mining accidents; and  competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction or oil and gas development.         if any of these conditions or events occurs, particularly at our black thunder mining complex, which accounted for approximately 67% of the coal volume we sold in 2011, our coal mining operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments or our operating costs could increase significantly. in addition, if our insurance coverage is limited or excludes certain of these conditions or events, then we may not be able to recover any of the losses we may incur as a result of such conditions or events, some of which may be substantial. competition within the coal industry could put downward pressure on coal prices and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.         we compete with numerous other coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales. international demand for u.s. coal also affects competition within our industry. the demand for u.s. coal exports depends upon a number of factors outside our control, including the overall demand for electricity in foreign markets, currency exchange rates, ocean freight rates, port and shipping capacity, the demand for foreign-priced steel, both in foreign markets and in the u.s. market, general economic conditions in foreign countries, technological developments and environmental and other governmental regulations. foreign demand for central appalachian coal has increased in recent periods. if foreign demand for u.s. coal were to decline, this decline could cause competition among coal producers for the sale of coal in the united states to intensify, potentially resulting in significant downward pressure on domestic coal prices.         in addition, during the mid-1970s and early 1980s, increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in additional production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. increases in coal prices over the past several years have encouraged the development of expanded capacity by coal producers and may continue to do so. any resulting overcapacity and increased production could materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. decreases in demand for electricity resulting from economic, weather changes or other conditions could adversely affect coal prices and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.         our coal is primarily used as fuel for electricity generation. overall economic activity and the associated demand for power by industrial users can have significant effects on overall electricity demand. an economic slowdown can significantly slow the growth of electrical demand and could result in contraction of demand for coal. declines in international prices for coal generally will impact u.s. prices for coal. during the past several years, international demand for coal has been driven, in significant part, by fluctuations in demand due to economic growth in china and india as well as other developing countries. significant declines in the rates of economic growth in these regions could materially affect international demand for u.s. coal, which may have an adverse effect on u.s. coal prices.         weather patterns can also greatly affect electricity demand. extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage and, therefore, increased generating requirements from all sources. mild temperatures, on the other hand, result in lower electrical demand, which allows generators to choose the sources of power generation when deciding which generation sources to dispatch. any downward pressure on coal prices, due to decreases in 38 table of contents overall demand or otherwise, including changes in weather patterns, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. the use of alternative energy sources for power generation could reduce coal consumption by u.s. electric power generators, which could result in lower prices for our coal. declines in the prices at which we sell our coal could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.         in 2011, approximately 91% of the tons we sold were to domestic electric power generators. the amount of coal consumed for u.s. electric power generation is affected by, among other things:  the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and  technological developments, including those related to alternative energy sources.         gas-fueled generation has the potential to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. we expect that many of the new power plants needed to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generators. in addition, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal. several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. there have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform, national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date. possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. our inability to acquire additional coal reserves or our inability to develop coal reserves in an economically feasible manner may adversely affect our business.         our profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine and process, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics desired by our customers. as we mine, our coal reserves decline. as a result, our future success depends upon our ability to acquire additional coal that is economically recoverable. if we fail to acquire or develop additional coal reserves, our existing reserves will eventually be depleted. we may not be able to obtain replacement reserves when we require them. if available, replacement reserves may not be available at favorable prices, or we may not be capable of mining those reserves at costs that are comparable with our existing coal reserves. our ability to obtain coal reserves in the future could also be limited by the availability of cash we generate from our operations or available financing, restrictions under our existing or future financing arrangements, and competition from other coal producers, the lack of suitable acquisition or lease-by-application, or lba, opportunities or the inability to acquire coal properties or lbas on commercially reasonable terms. if we are unable to acquire replacement reserves, our future production may decrease significantly and our operating results may be negatively affected. in addition, we may not be able to mine future reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.         our future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. we base our estimates of reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled, analyzed and reviewed by internal and third-party engineers and consultants. we update our estimates of the quantity and quality of proven and probable coal reserves annually to reflect the production of coal from the 39 table of contents reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, the tonnage contained in new lease areas acquired and estimated costs of production and sales prices. there are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine, coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control, including the following:  quality of the coal;  geological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;  the percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;  the assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severance and excise taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;  assumptions concerning the timing for the development of the reserves; and  assumptions concerning equipment and productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.         as a result, estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production, and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary materially due to changes in the above factors and assumptions. actual production recovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenues and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates. any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues and/or higher than expected costs. increases in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies, including steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, or the inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies, could negatively affect our operating costs or disrupt or delay our production.         our coal mining operations use significant amounts of steel, diesel fuel, explosives, rubber tires and other mining and industrial supplies. the cost of roof bolts we use in our underground mining operations depend on the price of scrap steel. we also use significant amounts of diesel fuel and tires for the trucks and other heavy machinery we use, particularly at our black thunder mining complex. if the prices of mining and other industrial supplies, particularly steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, increase, our operating costs could be negatively affected. in addition, if we are unable to procure these supplies, our coal mining operations may be disrupted or we could experience a delay or halt in our production. disruptions in the quantities of coal produced by our contract mine operators or purchased from other third parties could temporarily impair our ability to fill customer orders or increase our operating costs.         we use independent contractors to mine coal at certain of our mining complexes, including select operations in our appalachian segment. in addition, we purchase coal from third parties that we sell to our customers. operational difficulties at contractor-operated mines or mines operated by third parties from whom we purchase coal, changes in demand for contract miners from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability, pricing, and quality of coal produced for or purchased by us. disruptions in the quantities of coal produced for or purchased by us could impair our ability to fill our customer orders or require us to purchase coal from other sources in order to satisfy those orders. if we are unable to fill a customer order or if we are required to purchase coal from other sources in order to satisfy a customer order, we could lose existing customers and our operating costs could increase. 40 table of contents our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates.         we have contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies under which they purchase the coal for their own account or resell the coal to end users. our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. if we determine that a customer is not creditworthy, we may not be required to deliver coal under the customer's coal sales contract. if this occurs, we may decide to sell the customer's coal on the spot market, which may be at prices lower than the contracted price, or we may be unable to sell the coal at all. furthermore, the bankruptcy of any of our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position. in addition, our customer base may change with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties that may be less creditworthy, thereby increasing the risk we bear for customer payment default. these new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade, or may become below investment grade after we enter into contracts with them. in addition, competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk of payment default. a defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.         we conduct a significant part of our coal mining operations on properties that we lease. a title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves. we may not verify title to our leased properties or associated coal reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. we may not commit to develop property or coal reserves until we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. as such, the title to property that we intend to lease or coal reserves that we intend to mine may contain defects prohibiting our ability to conduct mining operations. similarly, our leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of other third parties. in order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. in addition, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and require us to pay minimum production royalties. our inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate. the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.         we depend upon barge, ship, rail, truck and belt transportation systems, as well as seaborne vessels and port facilities, to deliver coal to our customers. disruptions in transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, and other events could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers. as we do not have long-term contracts with transportation providers to ensure consistent and reliable service, decreased performance levels over longer periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs. in addition, increases in transportation costs, including the price of gasoline and diesel fuel, could make coal a less competitive source of energy when compared to alternative fuels or could make coal produced in one region of the united states less competitive than coal produced in other regions of the united states or abroad. if we experience disruptions in our transportation services or if transportation costs increase significantly and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, our coal mining operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or our profitability could decrease significantly. our profitability depends upon the long-term coal supply agreements we have with our customers. changes in purchasing patterns in the coal industry could make it difficult for us to extend our existing long-term coal supply agreements or to enter into new agreements in the future.         we sell a portion of our coal under long-term coal supply agreements, which we define as contracts with terms greater than one year. under these arrangements, we fix the prices of coal shipped during the initial year and may adjust the prices in later years. as a result, at any given time the market prices for similar-quality coal may exceed 41 table of contents the prices for coal shipped under these arrangements. changes in the coal industry may cause some of our customers not to renew, extend or enter into new long-term coal supply agreements with us or to enter into agreements to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on different terms or prices. in addition, uncertainty caused by federal and state regulations, including the clean air act, could deter our customers from entering into long-term coal supply agreements.         because we sell a portion of our coal production under long-term coal supply agreements, our ability to capitalize on more favorable market prices may be limited. conversely, at any given time we are subject to fluctuations in market prices for the quantities of coal that we have produced but which we have not committed to sell. as described above under "a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could negatively affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves," the market prices for coal may be volatile and may depend upon factors beyond our control. our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to sell uncommitted production at favorable prices or at all. for more information about our long-term coal supply agreements, you should see the section entitled "long-term coal supply arrangements." a decline in demand for metallurgical coal would limit our ability to sell our high quality steam coal as higher-priced metallurgical coal and could substantially affect our business.         portions of our coal reserves possess quality characteristics that enable us to mine, process and market them as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal, depending on the prevailing conditions in the metallurgical and steam coal markets. we decide whether to mine, process and market these coals as metallurgical or steam coal based on management's assessment as to which market is likely to provide us with a higher margin. we consider a number of factors when making this assessment, including the difference between the current and anticipated future market prices of steam coal and metallurgical coal and the increased costs incurred in producing coal for sale in the metallurgical market instead of the steam market. a decline in the metallurgical market relative to the steam market could cause us, as well as our competitors, to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability and increasing the availability of coal to customers in the steam market. the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our profitability.         for the year ended december 31, 2011, we derived approximately 15% of our total coal revenues from sales to our three largest customers and approximately 37% of our total coal revenues from sales to our ten largest customers. we expect to renew, extend or enter into new long-term coal supply agreements with those and other customers. however, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining long-term coal supply agreements with those customers, and those customers may discontinue purchasing coal from us. if any of those customers, particularly any of our three largest customers, was to significantly reduce the quantities of coal it purchases from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to those customers on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current long-term coal supply agreements, our profitability could suffer significantly. we have limited protection during adverse economic conditions and may face economic penalties if we are unable to satisfy certain quality specifications under our long-term coal supply agreements.         our long-term coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing the parties to temporarily suspend performance during specified events beyond their control. most of our long-term coal supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal that satisfies certain quality specifications, such as heat value, sulfur content, ash content, hardness and ash fusion temperature. these provisions in our long-term coal supply agreements could result in negative economic consequences to us, including price adjustments, purchasing replacement coal in a higher-priced open market, the rejection of deliveries or, in the extreme, contract termination. our profitability may be negatively affected if we are unable to seek protection during adverse economic conditions or if we incur financial or other economic penalties as a result of these provisions of our long-term supply agreements. 42 table of contents failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal.         federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers' compensation costs, coal leases and other obligations. we may have difficulty procuring or maintaining our surety bonds. our bond issuers may demand higher fees, additional collateral, including letters of credit or other terms less favorable to us upon those renewals. because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds in place before mining can commence or continue, or failure to maintain surety bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal. that failure could result from a variety of factors, including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms, the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety and restrictions on availability on collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our financing arrangements. our profitability may be adversely affected if we must satisfy certain below-market contracts with coal we purchase on the open market or with coal we produce at our remaining operations.         we have agreed to guarantee magnum's obligations to supply coal under certain coal sales contracts that we sold to magnum. in addition, we have agreed to purchase coal from magnum in order to satisfy our obligations under certain other contracts that have not yet been transferred to magnum, the longest of which extends to the year 2017. if magnum cannot supply the coal required under these coal sales contracts, we would be required to purchase coal on the open market or supply coal from our existing operations in order to satisfy our obligations under these contracts. at december 31, 2011, if we had purchased the 10.5 million tons of coal required under these contracts over their duration at market prices then in effect, we would have incurred a loss of approximately $214.7 million. we may incur losses as a result of certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies.         we seek to optimize our coal production and leverage our knowledge of the coal industry through a variety of marketing, trading and other asset optimization strategies. we maintain a system of complementary processes and controls designed to monitor and control our exposure to market and other risks as a consequence of these strategies. these processes and controls seek to balance our ability to profit from certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies with our exposure to potential losses. while we employ a variety of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques and accompanying judgments cannot anticipate every potential outcome or the timing of such outcomes. in addition, the processes and controls that we use to manage our exposure to market and other risks resulting from these strategies involve assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various assets or other market indicators. these correlations may change significantly in times of market turbulence or other unforeseen circumstances. as a result, we may experience volatility in our earnings as a result of our marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies. recent international growth in our operations adds new and unique risks to our business.         within the past year we opened offices in singapore and the united kingdom. the international expansion of our operations increases our exposure to country and currency risks. in addition, our international offices are selling our coal to new customers and customers in new countries, whose business practices and reputations are not as well known to us. we are also challenged by political risks by expanding internationally, including the potential for expropriation of assets and limits on the repatriation of earnings. in the event that we are unable to effectively manage these new risks, our results of operations, financial position or cash flow could be adversely affected by these activities. 43 table of contents we may not be able to fully integrate the operations of icg into our existing operations.         we believe that the acquisition of icg will result in various benefits or synergies, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of arch coal and icg can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. in addition, the combined company may experience unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.         it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated or cost more than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing or cost of their realization. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects, and may cause the combined company's stock price to decline. risks related to our indebtedness the amount of indebtedness we have incurred could significantly affect our business.         at december 31, 2011, we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately $4.0 billion. we also have significant lease and royalty obligations. our ability to satisfy our debt, lease and royalty obligations, and our ability to refinance our indebtedness, will depend upon our future operating performance. our ability to satisfy our financial obligations may be adversely affected if we incur additional indebtedness in the future. in addition, the amount of indebtedness we have incurred could have significant consequences to us, such as:  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, such as new lba acquisitions or other mergers and acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other cash requirements  exposing us to the risk of increased interest costs if the underlying interest rates rise;  limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business due to existing debt service requirements;  making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or other financing, particularly during weak credit markets;  causing a decline in our credit ratings;  limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;  limiting our ability to acquire new coal reserves and/or plant and equipment needed to conduct operations; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we compete and general economic and market conditions.         if we further increase our indebtedness, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could intensify. in addition to the principal repayments on our outstanding debt, we have other demands on our cash resources, including capital expenditures and operating expenses. our ability to pay our debt depends upon our operating performance. in particular, economic conditions could cause our revenues to decline, and hamper our ability to repay our indebtedness. if we do not have enough cash to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may be 44 table of contents required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets or reduce our spending. we may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all. a failure of a financial institution to fulfill their commitments under our credit facility could adversely affect our business.         as of december 31, 2011, we had borrowings of $375 million under our $2 billion dollar revolving credit facility. this facility is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. in the event one or more of these financial institutions were to default on their obligation to fund their respective portion of the commitment under the credit agreement, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to us and would result in a decrease in our available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement. we may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and other financing arrangements.         the agreements governing our outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions on us. for example, the terms of our credit facilities, leases and other financing arrangements contain financial and other covenants that create limitations on our ability to borrow the full amount under our credit facilities, effect acquisitions or dispositions and incur additional debt and require us to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants. our ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. a failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to borrow under our credit facilities or result in an event of default under these agreements. in the event of a default, our lenders and the counterparties to our other financing arrangements could terminate their commitments to us and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and fees, immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, we might not be able to pay these amounts, or we might be forced to seek an amendment to our financing arrangements which could make the terms of these arrangements more onerous for us. as a result, a default under one or more of our existing or future financing arrangements could have significant consequences for us. for more information about some of the restrictions contained in our credit facilities, leases and other financial arrangements, you should see the section entitled "liquidity and capital resources." risks related to environmental, other regulations and legislation extensive environmental regulations, including existing and potential future regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, affect our customers and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.         coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. the operations of our customers are subject to extensive environmental regulation particularly with respect to air emissions. for example, the federal clean air act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants, which are the largest end-users of our coal. a series of more stringent requirements relating to particulate matter, ozone, haze, mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other air pollutants are expected to be proposed or become effective in coming years. in addition, concerted conservation efforts that result in reduced electricity consumption could cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.         considerable uncertainty is associated with these air emissions initiatives. the content of regulatory requirements in the united states is in the process of being developed, and many new regulatory initiatives remain subject to review by federal or state agencies or the courts. stringent air emissions limitations are either in place or are likely to be imposed in the short to medium term, and these limitations will likely require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fueled power plants. as a result, these power plants may switch to other fuels 45 table of contents that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment that reduces the need for low sulfur coal, possibly reducing future demand for coal and a reduced need to construct new coal-fueled power plants. the eia's expectations for the coal industry assume there will be a significant number of as yet unplanned coal-fired plants built in the future which may not occur. any switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired plants, or reduced construction of new plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for and prices received for our coal. alternatively, less stringent air emissions limitations, particularly related to sulfur, to the extent enacted could make low sulfur coal less attractive, which could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for and prices received for our coal.         you should see "environmental and other regulatory matters" for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting us. our failure to obtain and renew permits necessary for our mining operations could negatively affect our business.         mining companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters in connection with coal mining. these include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. the permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by the regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations. the public, including non-governmental organizations, anti-mining groups and individuals, have certain statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and environmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens' lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or performance of mining activities. accordingly, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow and profitability. federal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' demands.         federal or state regulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. if this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. in the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. however, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. if these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery or terminate customers' contracts. any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. extensive environmental regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could materially increase those costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal.         the coal mining industry is subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters such as:  limitations on land use; 46 table of contents  mine permitting and licensing requirements;  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;  management of materials generated by mining operations;  the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;  remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater;  air quality standards;  water pollution;  protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species;  protection of wetlands;  the discharge of materials into the environment;  the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability; and  the management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls.         the costs, liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. we may incur material costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. if we are pursued for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our mining operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.         new legislation or administrative regulations or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations, including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. you should see the section entitled "environmental and other regulatory matters" for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting us. if the assumptions underlying our estimates of reclamation and mine closure obligations are inaccurate, our costs could be greater than anticipated.         smcra and counterpart state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, as well as most aspects of underground mining. we base our estimates of reclamation and mine closure liabilities on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. the estimates can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. we are required to record new obligations as liabilities at fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. in estimating fair value, we considered the estimated current costs of reclamation and mine closure and applied inflation rates and a third-party profit, as required. the third-party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf. the resulting estimated reclamation and mine closure obligations could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 47 table of contents our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.         our operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. we could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.         we maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes. such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. slurry impoundments have been known to fail, releasing large volumes of coal slurry into the surrounding environment. structural failure of an impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure. if one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.         drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as "acid mine drainage," which we refer to as amd. the treating of amd can be costly. although we do not currently face material costs associated with amd, it is possible that we could incur significant costs in the future.         these and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us. judicial rulings that restrict how we may dispose of mining wastes could significantly increase our operating costs, discourage customers from purchasing our coal and materially harm our financial condition and operating results.         to dispose of mining overburden generated by our surface mining operations, we often need to obtain permits to construct and operate valley fills and surface impoundments. some of these permits are clean water act § 404 permits issued by the army corps of engineers. two of our operating subsidiaries were identified in an existing lawsuit, which challenged the issuance of such permits and asked that the corps be ordered to rescind them. two of our operating subsidiaries intervened in the suit to protect their interests in being allowed to operate under the issued permits, and one of them thereafter was dismissed. on february 13, 2009, the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled on appeals from decisions rendered prior to our intervention, which may have a favorable impact on our permits. the matter is pending before the u.s. district court for the southern district of west virginia on mingo logan's motion for summary judgment. changes in the legal and regulatory environment could complicate or limit our business activities, increase our operating costs or result in litigation.         the conduct of our businesses is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the united states. these laws and regulations may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events or in response to significant events. certain recent developments particularly may cause changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities. such legal and regulatory environment changes may include changes in: the processes for obtaining or renewing permits; costs associated with providing healthcare benefits to employees; health and safety standards; accounting standards; taxation requirements; and competition laws. 48 table of contents         for example, in april 2010, the epa issued comprehensive guidance regarding the water quality standards that epa believes should apply to certain new and renewed clean water act permit applications for appalachian surface coal mining operations. under the epa's guidance, applicants seeking to obtain state and federal clean water act permits for surface coal mining in appalachia must perform an evaluation to determine if a reasonable potential exists that the proposed mining would cause a violation of water quality standards. according to the epa administrator, the water quality standards set forth in the epa's guidance may be difficult for most surface mining operations to meet. additionally, the epa's guidance contains requirements for the avoidance and minimization of environmental and mining impacts, consideration of the full range of potential impacts on the environment, human health and local communities, including low-income or minority populations, and provision of meaningful opportunities for public participation in the permit process. epa's guidance is subject to several pending legal challenges related to its legal effect and sufficiency including consolidated challenges pending in federal district court in the district of columbia led by the national mining association. we may be required to meet these requirements in the future in order to obtain and maintain permits that are important to our appalachian operations. we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to meet these or any other new standards.         in response to the april 2010 explosion at massey energy company's upper big branch mine and the ensuing tragedy, we expect that safety matters pertaining to underground coal mining operations will be the topic of new legislation and regulation, as well as the subject of heightened enforcement efforts. for example, federal and west virginia state authorities have announced special inspections of coal mines to evaluate several safety concerns, including the accumulation of coal dust and the proper ventilation of gases such as methane. in addition, both federal and west virginia state authorities have announced that they are considering changes to mine safety rules and regulations which could potentially result in additional or enhanced required safety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter and more thorough enforcement practices and enhanced reporting requirements. any new environmental, health and safety requirements may increase the costs associated with obtaining or maintain permits necessary to perform our mining operations or otherwise may prevent, delay or reduce our planned production, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.         further, mining companies are entitled a tax deduction for percentage depletion, which may allow for depletion deductions in excess of the basis in the mineral reserves. the deduction is currently being reviewed by the federal government for repeal. if repealed, the inability to take a tax deduction for percentage depletion could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future tax payments. item 1b.    unresolved
