item 1a. risk factors.   risk factors   risk factors related to our business   our 10 largest clients represented 45.1% of our consolidated revenue in 2011 and the loss of any of these clients could cause a significant drop in our revenue.   we depend on a limited number of large clients for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. our 10 largest clients represented approximately 45.1% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended december 31, 2011, with bank of montreal representing approximately 11.1% of our 2011 consolidated revenue. a decrease in revenue from any of our significant clients for any reason, including a decrease in pricing or activity, or a decision either to utilize another service provider or to no longer outsource some or all of the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenue.   loyaltyone. loyaltyone represents 26.6% of our consolidated revenue. our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 82.6% of our loyaltyone revenue in 2011. bank of montreal and canada safeway represented approximately 41.9% and 12.6%, respectively, of this segment’s revenue for 2011. our contract with bank of montreal expires in 2013 and our contract with canada safeway expires in 2015, each subject to automatic renewals at five-year intervals.   epsilon. epsilon represents 26.7% of our consolidated revenue. our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 30.3% of our epsilon revenue in 2011.   private label services and credit. private label services and credit represents 46.9% of our consolidated revenue. our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 72.1% of our private label services and credit revenue in 2011. limited brands and its retail affiliates and charming shoppes’ retail affiliates represented approximately 18.3% and 11.1%, respectively, of our revenue for this segment in 2011. our contracts with limited brands and its retail affiliates expire in 2018 and our contracts with charming shoppes’ retail affiliates expire in 2019.   the markets for the services that we offer may contract or fail to expand which could negatively impact our growth and profitability.   our growth and continued profitability depend on acceptance of the services that we offer. our clients may not continue to use the loyalty and targeted marketing strategies and programs that we offer. changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to directly process transactions in a cost-efficient manner without the use of our services. additionally, downturns in the economy or the performance of retailers may result in a decrease in the demand for our marketing strategies. further, if customers make fewer purchases of our private label services and credit customers’ products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue. any decrease in the demand for our services for the reasons discussed above or any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenue and operating results.   competition in our industries is intense and we expect it to intensify.   the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in each of those markets. many of our current competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. certain of our segments also compete against in-house staffs of our current clients and others or internally developed products and services by our current clients and others. for example, as a result of increasing competitors in the loyalty market, including from aeroplan, air canada’s frequent flyer program, we may experience greater competition in attracting and retaining sponsors in our air miles reward program. our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our programs to consumers. we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors.   10 index   if actual redemptions by air miles reward program collectors are greater than expected, or if the costs related to redemption of air miles reward miles increase, our profitability could be adversely affected.   a portion of our revenue is based on our estimate of the number of air miles reward miles that will go unused by the collector base. the percentage of unredeemed air miles reward miles is known as “breakage” in the loyalty industry. effective december 31, 2011, air miles reward miles expire if not redeemed in five years. we experience breakage when air miles reward miles are not redeemed by collectors for a number of reasons, including:     • loss of interest in the program or sponsors;     • collectors moving out of the program area; and     • death of a collector.   if actual redemptions are greater than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected due to the cost of the excess redemptions. in addition, since we recognize revenue over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile, for those air miles reward miles subject to breakage, any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, breakage could adversely affect our profitability.   our air miles reward program also exposes us to risks arising from potentially increasing reward costs. our profitability could be adversely affected if costs related to redemption of air miles reward miles increase. a 10% increase in the cost of redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of $41.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2011.   the loss of our most active air miles reward program collectors could negatively affect our growth and profitability.   our most active air miles reward program collectors drive a disproportionately large percentage of our air miles reward program revenue. the loss of a significant portion of these collectors, for any reason, could impact our ability to generate significant revenue from sponsors. the continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will depend in large part on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive.   failure to safeguard our databases and consumer privacy could affect our reputation among our clients and their customers, and may expose us to legal claims.   although we have extensive physical and cyber security and associated procedures, our databases may be subject to unauthorized access. if we experience a security breach, the integrity of our databases could be affected. security and privacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to support our profiling capability. the use of our loyalty, marketing services or credit card programs could decline if any compromise of physical or cyber security occurred. in addition, any unauthorized release of customer information or any public perception that we released consumer information without authorization, could subject us to legal claims from customers, consumers or regulatory enforcement actions and adversely affect our client relationships.   loss of data center capacity, interruption due to cyber attacks, loss of telecommunication links or inability to utilize proprietary software of third party vendors could affect our ability to timely meet the needs of our clients and their customers.   our ability, and that of our third-party service providers, to protect our data centers against damage, loss or inoperability from fire, power loss, cyber attacks, telecommunications failure, computer viruses and other disasters is critical. in order to provide many of our services, we must be able to store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data as well as periodically expand and upgrade our database capabilities. any damage to our data centers, or those of our third-party service providers, any failure of our telecommunication links that interrupts our operations or any impairment of our ability to use our software or the proprietary software of third party vendors, including impairments due to cyber attacks, could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs and their confidence in utilizing us for future services.   we rely on third party vendors to provide products and services. our profitability could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations.   the failure of our suppliers to deliver products and services in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. if our significant vendors were unable to renew our existing contracts, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at the same cost which would negatively impact our profitability.   11 index   our level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to repay our outstanding debt, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs.   we have a high level of indebtedness, which requires a high level of interest and principal payments. subject to the limits contained in our credit agreement, our indenture governing the convertible senior notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. if we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify. our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. our higher level of indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could:     • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing our convertible senior notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;     • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;     • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage;     • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;     • limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes;     • reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures;     • cause any refinancing of our indebtedness to be at higher interest rates and require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations; and     • prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the convertible senior notes.   interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings.   interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities. our borrowing costs were approximately $298.6 million for 2011. to manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. to achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. in addition, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes.   conversion of the convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.   the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the conversion of the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.   future sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales could occur, may adversely affect our common stock price.   as of february 21, 2012, we had an aggregate of 100,123,460 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. in general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. we have reserved 24,003,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and our long-term incentive plans, of which 2,224,735 shares are issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and upon exercise of options granted as of february 21, 2012, including options to purchase approximately 650,050 shares exercisable as of february 21, 2012 or that will become exercisable within 60 days after february 21, 2012. we have reserved for issuance 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, 850,020 of which remain issuable, under our 401(k) and retirement savings plan as of december 31, 2011. in addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders.     12 index   we do not intend to pay cash dividends.   we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors that our board deems relevant.   if we fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to integrate the businesses we acquire, it could negatively affect our business.   historically, we have engaged in a significant number of acquisitions, and those acquisitions have contributed to our growth in revenue and profitability. we believe that acquisitions will continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. however, we may not be able to continue to locate and secure acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us. if we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, our growth could be impaired.   there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions, including:     • the difficulty and expense that we incur in connection with the acquisition;     • adverse accounting consequences of conforming the acquired company’s accounting policies to ours;     • the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;     • the potential loss of customers or key employees of the acquired company;     • the impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition or the failure to meet operating expectations of the acquired business; and     • the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company.   acquisitions that we make may not be successfully integrated into our ongoing operations and we may not achieve any expected cost savings or other synergies from any acquisition. if the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations, our profitability and cash flows may be impaired and we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business.   we expect growth in our private label services and credit segment to result from new and acquired credit card programs whose credit card receivable performance could result in increased portfolio losses and negatively impact our earnings.   we expect an important source of growth in our credit card operations to come from the acquisition of existing credit card programs and initiating credit card programs with retailers who do not currently offer a private label or co-branded retail credit card. although we believe our pricing and models for determining credit risk are designed to evaluate the credit risk of existing programs and the credit risk we are willing to assume for acquired and start-up programs, we cannot assure you that the loss experience on acquired and start-up programs will be consistent with our more established programs. the failure to successfully underwrite these credit card programs may result in defaults greater than our expectations and could have a materially adverse impact on us and our earnings.   if we are unable to securitize our credit card receivables due to changes in the market, we would not be able to fund new credit card receivables, which would have a negative impact on our operations and earnings.   a number of factors affect our ability to fund our receivables in the securitization market, some of which are beyond our control, including:     • conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset-backed securitization market in particular;     • conformity in the quality of private label credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in that quality or those requirements; and     • ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements, which are routinely utilized in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower borrowing cost.     13 index   in addition, on april 7, 2010, the sec proposed revised rules for asset-backed securities offerings that, if adopted, would substantially change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset-backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. on july 26, 2011, the sec re-proposed certain rules relating to the registrant and transaction requirements for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities. if the revised rules for asset-backed securities are adopted in their current form, issuers of publicly offered asset-backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets. in addition, the proposals would alter the safe-harbor standards for the private placement of asset-backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities. the sec also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts relied on in our credit card securitization program to avoid registration as investment companies. the form that these rules may ultimately take is uncertain at this time, but such rules may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.   on march 30, 2011, the sec, the fdic, the federal reserve and certain other banking regulators proposed regulations that would mandate a five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations. we cannot predict at this time whether our existing credit card securitization programs will satisfy the new regulatory requirements or whether structural changes to those programs will be necessary. such risk retention requirements may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.   the inability to securitize card receivables due to changes in the market, regulatory proposals, the unavailability of credit enhancements, or any other circumstance or event would have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings.   recent legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.   on july 21, 2010, the dodd-frank act wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, or the dodd-frank act, was enacted into law. the dodd-frank act, among other things, includes a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as of the regulation of derivatives and capital market activities.   the full impact of the dodd-frank act is difficult to assess because many provisions require federal agencies to adopt implementing regulations. in addition, the dodd-frank act mandates multiple studies, which could result in future legislative or regulatory action. in particular, the government accountability office issued its study on whether it is necessary, in order to strengthen the safety and soundness of institutions or the stability of the financial system of the united states, to eliminate the exemptions to the definition of “bank” under the bank holding company act for certain institutions including limited purpose credit card banks and industrial loan companies. the study did not recommend the elimination of these exemptions. however, if legislation were enacted to eliminate these exemptions without any grandfathering or accommodations for existing institutions, we could be required to become a bank holding company and cease certain of our activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies or divest our credit card services bank subsidiary, wfnb, or our industrial bank, wfcb.   the dodd-frank act also creates a consumer financial protection bureau, or cfpb, a new federal consumer protection regulator with authority to make further changes to the federal consumer protection laws and regulations. it is unclear what changes will be promulgated by the cfpb and what effect, if any, such changes would have on our business and operations. the cfpb assumed rulemaking authority under the existing federal consumer financial protection laws, and will enforce those laws against and examine certain non-depository institutions and insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion and their affiliates.   while the cfpb will not examine wfnb and wfcb, it will receive information from their primary federal regulator. in addition, the cfpb’s broad rulemaking authority is expected to impact their operations. for example, the cfpb’s rulemaking authority may allow it to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators including regulations issued under the truth in lending act or the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009, or the card act, by the board of governors of the federal reserve system. the cfpb’s ability to rescind, modify or interpret past regulatory guidance could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. furthermore, the cfpb has broad authority to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive” practices. if the cfpb were to exercise this authority, it could result in requirements to alter our products that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably.   the dodd-frank act authorizes certain state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the dodd-frank act’s general prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the federal banking agencies, we may be required to alter products or services offered in some jurisdictions or cease offering products, which will increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide.   the effect of the dodd-frank act on our business and operations could be significant, depending upon final implementing regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. in addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the dodd-frank act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it. the dodd-frank act and any related legislation or regulations may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   14 index   increases in net charge-offs beyond our current estimates could have a negative impact on our net income and profitability.   the primary risk associated with unsecured consumer lending is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the borrower, resulting in the borrower’s balance being charged-off as uncollectible. we rely principally on the customer’s creditworthiness for repayment of the loan and therefore have no other recourse for collection. we may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of cardholders to minimize delinquencies and losses. an increase in defaults or net charge-offs could result in a reduction in net income. general economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. in addition to being affected by general economic conditions and the success of our collection and recovery efforts, our delinquency and net credit card receivable charge-off rates are affected by the credit risk of our credit card receivables and the average age of our various credit card account portfolios. the average age of our credit card receivables affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio. an older credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio. our pricing strategy may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses, thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. for 2011, our average credit card receivables net charge-off rate was 6.9% compared to 8.9% and 9.3% for 2010 and 2009, respectively.   the hedging activity related to the activities of the credit card securitization trusts and our floating rate indebtedness subjects us to counterparty risks relating to the creditworthiness of the commercial banks with whom we enter into hedging transactions.   in order to execute hedging strategies related to the credit card securitization trusts and our floating rate indebtedness, we have entered into interest rate derivative contracts with commercial banks. these banks are otherwise known as counterparties. it is our policy to enter into such contracts with counterparties that are deemed to be creditworthy. however, if macro- or micro-economic events were to negatively impact these banks, the banks might not be able to honor their obligations either to us or to the credit card securitization trusts and we might suffer a direct loss.   a failure by a counterparty to deliver shares or pay amounts due to us upon completion of a transaction, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our common stock or a decline in our earnings per share.   a failure by a forward counterparty, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, to deliver shares of our common stock at settlement or upon acceleration of its respective prepaid forward could result in the recording of those shares as issued and outstanding for purposes of computing and reporting our basic and diluted weighted average shares and earnings per share. this may lead to a decline in our earnings per share without our receiving a return of the purchase price for those shares that we paid to the relevant forward counterparty at the time we entered into the prepaid forward transaction.   a failure by a hedge counterparty, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, to pay to us amounts owed under the note hedge transactions entered into separately but concurrently with the sale of our convertible senior notes will not reduce the consideration we are required to deliver to a holder upon conversion of its convertible senior notes, which may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our common stock and lead to a decline in our earnings per share or both.   airline or travel industry disruptions, such as an airline insolvency, could negatively affect the air miles reward program, our revenues and profitability.   air travel is one of the appeals of the air miles reward program to collectors. as a result of airline insolvencies and restructurings, we may experience service disruptions that prevent us from fulfilling collectors’ flight redemption requests. if one of our existing airline suppliers sharply reduces its fleet capacity and route network, we may not be able to satisfy our collectors’ demands for airline tickets. tickets from other airlines, if available, could be more expensive than a comparable ticket under our current supply agreements with existing suppliers, and the routes offered by the other airlines may be inadequate, inconvenient or undesirable to the redeeming collectors. as a result, we may experience higher air travel redemption costs, and collector satisfaction with the air miles reward program might be adversely affected.   as a result of airline or travel industry disruptions, political instability, terrorist acts or war, some collectors could determine that air travel is too dangerous or burdensome. consequently, collectors might forego redeeming air miles reward miles for air travel and therefore might not participate in the air miles reward program to the extent they previously did, which could adversely affect our revenue from the program.   15 index   as a result of our significant canadian operations, our reported financial information will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. and canadian dollars.   we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. and canadian dollars through our significant canadian operations. we do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary. a 10% increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $19.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2011. conversely, a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pre-tax income.   legislation relating to consumer privacy may affect our ability to collect data that we use in providing our loyalty and marketing services, which, among other things, could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients’ needs.   the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer or private sector privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services. legislation or industry regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy issues could place restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting some data. these types of legislation or industry regulations could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients’ requirements and our profitability and cash flow. data breach notification legislation has been proposed widely in the united states and europe. if enacted, these legislative measures could impose strict requirements on reporting time frames for providing notice, as well as the contents of such notices, to law enforcement, regulators and individuals. in addition to the united states and canadian regulations discussed below, we have expanded our marketing services through the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional or more stringent legislation and regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy.   in the united states, federal and state laws such as the federal gramm-leach-bliley act and the fair credit reporting act, as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003, make it more difficult to collect, share and use information that has previously been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. regulations under these acts give cardholders the ability to “opt out” of having information generated by their credit card purchases shared with other affiliated and unaffiliated parties or the public. our ability to gather, share and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to “opt out,” thereby precluding us and our affiliates from using their data.   in the united states, the federal do-not-call implementation act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with prospective and existing customers. similar measures were implemented in canada beginning september 1, 2008. regulations in both the united states and canada give consumers the ability to “opt out,” through a national do-not-call registry and state do-not-call registries of having telephone solicitations placed to them by companies that do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. in addition, regulations require companies to maintain an internal do-not-call list for those who do not want the companies to solicit them through telemarketing. these regulations could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.   in the united states, the federal controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages, the primary purpose of which is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, to our customers and prospective customers. the act requires that a commercial electronic mail message provide the customers with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving future commercial electronic mail messages from the sender. failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.   in canada, the personal information protection and electronic documents act requires an organization to obtain a consumer’s consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. under this act, consumer personal information may be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. we allow our customers to voluntarily “opt out” from receiving either one or both promotional and marketing mail or promotional and marketing electronic mail. heightened consumer awareness of, and concern about, privacy may result in customers “opting out” at higher rates than they have historically. this would mean that a reduced number of customers would receive bonus and promotional offers and therefore those customers may collect fewer air miles reward miles.   in canada, the fighting internet and wireless spam act restricts our ability to send commercial “electronic messages,” defined to include text, sound, voice and image messages to email, instant messaging, telephone or similar accounts, where the primary purpose is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service to our customers and prospective customers. the act requires that a sender have consent to send a commercial electronic message, and provide the customers with an opportunity to opt out from receiving future commercial electronic email messages from the sender. failure to comply with the terms of this act or any proposed regulations that may be adopted in the future could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.   16 index   our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.   third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. the actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. we may not be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. third parties may also assert infringement claims against us. any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party’s patent or to license alternative technology from another party. in addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.   current and proposed regulation and legislation relating to our retail credit card services could limit our business activities, product offerings and fees charged.   various federal and state laws and regulations significantly limit the retail credit card services activities in which we are permitted to engage. such laws and regulations, among other things, limit the fees and other charges that we can impose on consumers, limit or proscribe certain other terms of our products and services, require specified disclosures to consumers, or require that we maintain certain licenses, qualifications and minimum capital levels. in some cases, the precise application of these statutes and regulations is not clear. in addition, numerous legislative and regulatory proposals are advanced each year which, if adopted, could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability or further restrict the manner in which we conduct our activities. the card act, which was enacted in may 2009 and together with its implementing rules, became effective in 2010, acts to limit or modify certain credit card practices and require increased disclosures to consumers. the credit card practices addressed by the rules include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the application of rate increases to existing and new balances, payment allocation, default pricing, imposition of late fees and two-cycle billing. the failure to comply with, or adverse changes in, the laws or regulations to which our business is subject, or adverse changes in their interpretation, could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and generate fees on the receivables, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.   our bank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation that may require us to make capital contributions to them, and that may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to make cash available to us.   federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of wfnb, as well as wfcb. many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of wfnb and wfcb, and they impose significant restraints on them to which other non-regulated entities are not subject. as a state bank, wfnb is subject to overlapping supervision by the state of delaware and the fdic. as an industrial bank, wfcb is subject to overlapping supervision by the fdic and the state of utah. wfnb and wfcb must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. if wfnb and wfcb do not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. wfnb and wfcb, as institutions insured by the fdic, must maintain certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums and adequate allowances for loan loss. if either wfnb or wfcb were to fail to meet any of the capital requirements to which it is subject, we may be required to provide them with additional capital, which could impair our ability to service our indebtedness. to pay any dividend, wfnb and wfcb must each maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. accordingly, neither wfnb nor wfcb may be able to make any of its cash or other assets available to us, including servicing our indebtedness.   17 index   if our bank subsidiaries fail to meet certain criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the bank holding company act, which could force us to cease all of our non-banking activities and thus cause a drastic reduction in our profits and revenue.   if either of our depository institution subsidiaries failed to meet the criteria for the exemption from the definition of “bank” in the bank holding company act under which it operates (which exemptions are described below), and if we did not divest such depository institution upon such an occurrence, we would become subject to regulation under the bank holding company act. this would require us to cease certain of our activities that are not permissible for companies that are subject to regulation under the bank holding company act. one of our depository institution subsidiaries, wfnb, is a delaware state fdic-insured bank and a limited-purpose credit card bank located in delaware. wfnb will not be a “bank” as defined under the bank holding company act so long as it remains in compliance with the following requirements:     • it engages only in credit card operations;     • it does not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties;     • it does not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, except for deposits pledged as collateral for its extensions of credit;     • it maintains only one office that accepts deposits; and     • it does not engage in the business of making commercial loans (except small business loans).   our other depository institution subsidiary, wfcb, is a utah industrial bank that is authorized to do business by the state of utah and the fdic. wfcb will not be a “bank” as defined under the bank holding company act so long as it remains an industrial bank in compliance with the following requirements:     • it is an institution organized under the laws of a state which, on march 5, 1987, had in effect or had under consideration in such state’s legislature a statute which required or would require such institution to obtain insurance under the federal deposit insurance act; and     • it does not accept demand deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties.   if our industrial bank, wfcb, fails to meet the requirements of the fdic or state of utah, we may be subject to termination of our industrial  bank.   wfcb, as an industrial bank authorized to do business by the state of utah and the fdic, is subject to capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan loss. if wfcb fails to meet the requirements of the fdic or the state of utah, it may be subject to termination as an industrial bank.   anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, delaware law and the fundamental change purchase rights of our convertible senior notes may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent or delay change of control transactions or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.   delaware law, as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and debt instruments, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to our stockholders.   these include:     • a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;     • our board’s authority to issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval;     • provisions of delaware law providing that directors serving on staggered boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause; and     • fundamental change purchase rights of our convertible senior notes, which allow such note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as well as provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with make-whole fundamental changes.   in addition, we are subject to the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price of our common stock that they might otherwise receive.     18 index   item 1b. unresolved
