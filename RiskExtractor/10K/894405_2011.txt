item 1a.   risk factors   each of the following risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. our principal operations are conducted through our primary operating subsidiary, abf. for 2010, abf represented 92% of the companys consolidated revenues.   the transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control, any of which could significantly reduce our operating results.   factors that could have a negative impact on our performance in the future include, but are not limited to, general economic factors; an increasingly competitive industry and freight rate environment; loss of key employees; a workforce stoppage by our employees covered under our collective bargaining agreement; difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and/or dockworkers; volatile fuel prices as well as the rate of changes in associated fuel surcharges and the effect of fuel surcharge changes on securing increases in base freight rates and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or to obtain sufficient fuel supplies; antiterrorism measures; loss of third-party rail service providers; loss of market share to rail or other transportation sectors; violation of federal regulations and increasing costs for compliance with regulations; emissions-control regulations; violations of environmental laws or regulations; climate change legislation; costs or liabilities associated with legal proceedings; increasing capital requirements; increases in new equipment costs and decreases in the amount we are able to obtain for sales of our used equipment; decreases in the availability of new equipment; increases in the required contributions under our collective bargaining agreements with the ibt for wage contributions and/or benefits contributions to multiemployer plans; increases in the frequency and/or the severity of workers compensation and/or third-party casualty claims; increases in workers compensation and/or third-party casualty insurance premiums; delay in market penetration of our service and growth initiatives; unsuccessful business acquisitions; a failure of our information systems; weather or seasonal fluctuations, including any influence of climate change; and/or changes in accounting rules and requirements. the foregoing risks are largely out of our control and any one of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.   we are subject to general economic factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could significantly reduce our operating results.   our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers business cycles and changes in their business practices. recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation services. the pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. customers may select transportation services based on pricing alone, which may result in a loss of business for us in some cases. economic conditions could adversely affect our customers business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services. customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. in addition, customers could reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.   we depend on suppliers for equipment, parts and services that are critical to our operations. a disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or related financial constraints on our suppliers business levels could adversely impact our business and results of operations.   we are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. we have historically been subject to market risk due to variable interest rates, on all or a part of our borrowings under bank credit lines, and continue to be subject to such risk on our accounts receivable securitization facility. changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs in the event we need to borrow against our accounts receivable securitization facility, enter into additional capital lease arrangements or obtain additional sources of financing. furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our accounts receivable securitization facility, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing.     11 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   our qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust also holds investments in equity and debt securities. declines in the value of plan assets resulting from the instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. substantial future investment losses on plan assets would also increase pension expense in the years following the losses. investment returns that differ from expected returns are amortized to expense over the remaining active service period of plan participants. in addition, a change in the rate used to discount our pension obligations for financial statement purposes would change the projected pension obligation and impact pension expense, and a change in the rate used to calculate our funding requirements under the pension protection act (the ppa) would impact contributions required to fund our plan. an increase in pension expense may adversely impact our results of operations. significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. an increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. we could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may reduce our net income.   it is not possible to predict the effects of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the united states or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.   we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business could suffer if we were unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry.   numerous competitive factors could adversely impact our operating results. these factors include:   ·                  we compete with many other ltl carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion ltl carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads, some of which have greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages.   ·                  our nonunion competitors generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers. wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than ours and may impact our competitiveness in the ltl industry. our competitors could reduce their freight rates to gain market share, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy. the resulting increased pricing competition could limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins or grow tonnage levels.   ·                  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain or grow our business.   ·                  competition from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices.   ·                  our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our market share.   ·                 the trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger ltl carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. we could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining ltl carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size.   our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our success.   we benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. the unexpected loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability.     12 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   we depend on our employees to support our operating business and future growth opportunities. if our relationship with our employees were to deteriorate, we could be faced with labor disruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reduce our operating results and place us at a disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.   most of our union employees are covered under a five-year collective bargaining agreement with the ibt which expires on march 31, 2013. the agreement with the ibt provides for compounded annual contractual wage and benefit increases of approximately 4%, subject to wage rate cost-of-living adjustments.   we operate in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion ltl carriers. nonunion companies typically have similar wage costs but significantly lower fringe benefit costs compared to union companies. however, certain nonunion carriers reduced their wage rates for freight-handling and driving personnel in recent years, and wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have also allowed for a lower cost structure than that of abf. we have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. if we were unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.   we depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. fuel shortages, increases in fuel costs and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   the transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. we have not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were to develop. fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. for example, the average monthly price per gallon, excluding taxes, that we paid for fuel in 2009 and 2010 ranged from $1.38 to $2.57. we charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index. the fuel surcharge rate in effect is available on the abf web site at abf.com. (the information contained on the abf web site is not a part of this annual report on form 10-k nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.) although revenues from fuel surcharges generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. the total impact of higher energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. we cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. during periods of changing diesel fuel prices, the fuel surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary by different degrees. depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, operating results could be impacted. whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating income may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. throughout 2010, the fuel surcharge mechanism continued to have strong market acceptance among our customers, although certain nonstandard arrangements with some of abfs customers have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. while the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces based on value provided to the customer. as fuel prices decline, lower fuel surcharge levels may over time improve our ability to increase other elements of margin, although there can be no assurances in this regard. when fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase.   we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. significant changes in diesel fuel prices and the associated fuel surcharge may increase volatility in our fuel surcharge revenue and fuel-related costs. volatile fuel prices will continue to impact the base rate increases we are able to secure and could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results. significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.     13 table of contents   item 1a.    risk factors  continued   our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.   as a result of terrorist attacks on the united states, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. for example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. if security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so.   we depend on transportation provided by rail services and increased costs or disruption of these services could adversely affect our operations.   in 2010, rail utilization accounted for 14.3% of our total miles. a reduction in the availability of rail services could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. if a disruption in transportation services from our rail service providers occurred, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. if these situations occurred, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.   our business could be adversely impacted by increased competition from freight transportation service providers outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry.   in addition to ltl and truckload motor carriers, we compete against other freight transportation service providers, including railroads. certain challenges in the motor carrier freight transportation industry, such as the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; potential changes to driver hours of service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in more competitive service offerings of rail providers. recent growth in the rail transportation sector has resulted from general economic improvement and a conversion of truckload to intermodal shipping. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if railroads or other freight transportation sectors gain a significant share of the market for our services.   we operate in a highly regulated industry and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, contract compliance, insurance requirements, taxation and financial reporting. we could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics or cargo security. compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment productivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.   in january 2004, we implemented the current dot rules regulating driving time for commercial truck drivers. the rules have had a minimal impact upon our operations. however, future changes in these rules, including the proposed revision to the hours of service rules that were published in december 2010, could materially and adversely affect our operating efficiency and increase costs.   our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. the tsa has adopted regulations that require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo background checks by the federal bureau of investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.   csa regulations could potentially result in a loss of business to other carriers, driver shortages, increased costs for qualified drivers and driver and/or business suspension for noncompliance. csa scores are available to the general public. shippers may be influenced by the scores in selecting a carrier to haul their freight and, although abf is recognized in the industry for its commitment to safety, carriers with better csa scores may be selected in certain cases. a resulting decline in the availability of qualified drivers, coupled with additional personnel required to satisfy future revisions to hours of service     14 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   regulations, could adversely impact our ability to hire drivers to adequately meet current or future business needs. failures to comply with dot safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. unsatisfactory csa scores could result in a dot intervention or audit, resulting in the assessment of fines or penalties. a downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. the loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs. in addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.   increases in license and registration fees or taxes, including federal fuel taxes, or the implementation of new forms of operating taxes on the industry could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.   our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. the costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.   we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. we also store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks at some facilities. our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal. if we were involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.   concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the relatively near future. the company is unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. however, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment and diesel fuel, and future legislation, if passed, could result in increases in these and other costs. increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, including diesel engine emissions and/or total vehicle fuel economy, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. we may also be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure or our operating results. furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services.   we are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects to our business.   the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability and other matters. some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. our business reputation and our relationship with our employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in certain legal proceedings.   we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect profitability if we were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations.   we have significant ongoing capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing arrangements, or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased maintenance costs. if these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on our profitability.     15 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.   manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine design requirements mandated by the epa intended to reduce emissions. new epa engine design requirements became effective on january 1, 2007, and more restrictive epa emission-control design requirements became effective for engines built beginning january 1, 2010. a number of states have mandated, and states may continue to mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets. further equipment price increases may result from these federal and state requirements. if new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. if we were unable to offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. if the market value of revenue equipment being used in our operations were to decrease, we could incur impairment losses and our cash flows could be adversely affected.   during prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, we may make strategic fleet reductions. in addition, other trucking companies may reduce fleet levels during recessionary economic cycles, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. if market prices for used revenue equipment decline, we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale and our cash flows could be adversely affected.   the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, which could substantially increase operating expenses.   tractor engines that comply with the epa emission-control design requirements that took effect on january 1, 2007 are generally less fuel-efficient and have increased maintenance costs compared to engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. engine manufacturers have made adjustments to the operating software since the introduction of these engines that have resulted in slightly improved fuel economy. although we anticipate additional improvement in fuel economy as a result of the technologies to be implemented for compliance with the more stringent epa requirements that became effective for engines built beginning january 1, 2010, our costs to acquire and maintain compliant equipment could increase substantially. if we are unable to offset resulting increases in equipment costs with higher freight rates and fuel economy savings, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   from time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (oems) of tractors and trailers may also reduce their manufacturing output due, for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. component suppliers may also reduce production creating periodic difficulty for oems to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment as economic conditions change. an inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   we could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.   under the provisions of the taft-hartley act, retirement and health care benefits for our contractual employees are provided by a number of multiemployer plans. the trust funds for these plans are administered by trustees, an equal number of whom generally are appointed by the ibt and certain management carrier organizations or other appointing authorities for employer trustees as set forth in the funds trust agreements. we contribute to these plans monthly based generally on the time worked by our contractual employees, as specified in the collective bargaining agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. we recognize as expense the contractually required contribution for the period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.   we currently contribute to 26 multiemployer pension plans, which vary in size and in funded status. in the event of the termination of certain multiemployer pension plans or if abf were to withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, under current law, we would have material liabilities, the amounts of which could be in excess of our current ability to adequately finance, for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. we have not received notification of any plan termination, and we do not currently intend to withdraw from these plans.     16 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   in 2006, the ppa became law and, together with related regulations, established new minimum funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans. the ppa mandates that multiemployer pension plans that are below certain funded levels or that have projected funded deficiencies adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program to improve the funded levels over a defined period of time. the ppa also accelerates the timing of annual funding notices and requires additional disclosures from multiemployer pension plans if such plans fall below the required funded levels. based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended december 31, 2009, approximately 65% of our contributions to multiemployer pension plans, including the central states southeast and southwest area pension fund (the central states pension fund) discussed below, are made to plans that are in critical status and approximately 20% of our contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in endangered status as defined by the ppa.   the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 (the pension relief act) was signed into law in june 2010. the pension relief act includes provisions that may provide funding relief for multiemployer pension plans that satisfy certain solvency requirements. the company has not received information from the multiemployer plan administrators regarding the impact, if any, of the pension relief act on the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute. due to their funded positions, certain plans may not be eligible for funding relief provisions of the pension relief act because of its solvency requirements.   approximately 55% of our multiemployer pension contributions are made to the central states pension fund. the central states pension fund adopted a rehabilitation plan as a result of its actuarial certification for the plan year beginning january 1, 2008 which placed the central states pension fund in critical status. our current collective bargaining agreement complies with the rehabilitation plan which was adopted by the central states pension fund prior to the april 1, 2008 effective date of the collective bargaining agreement. the actuarial certification of plan status as of january 1, 2010 certified that the central states pension fund remains in critical status with a funded percentage of 63.1%. in accordance with ppa requirements, the central states pension fund adopted an updated rehabilitation plan effective december 31, 2010 which implements additional measures to improve the plans funded level, including establishing a minimum retirement age and actuarially adjusting certain pre-age 65 benefits for participants who retire after july 1, 2011. the updated rehabilitation plan also effectively caps the required pension contribution rates at the current levels for the rate class applicable to the nmfa; however, any changes to scheduled contribution rate increases under the current labor agreement, which ends on march 31, 2013, would be subject to approval by the bargaining parties. despite these changes, we can make no assurances of the extent to which the updated rehabilitation plan will improve the funded status of the central states pension fund.   in 2005, the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) granted an extension of the period of time over which the central states pension fund amortizes unfunded liabilities by ten years subject to the condition that a targeted funding ratio will be maintained by the fund. due, in part, to the decline in asset values associated with the investment losses in the financial markets during 2008, the funded level of the central states pension fund dropped below the targeted funding ratio set forth as a condition of the ten-year amortization extension beginning with the january 1, 2009 actuarial valuation. however, the amortization extension granted by the irs in 2005 expressly indicated that modifications of conditions would be considered in the event of unforeseen market fluctuations which cause the plan to fail the funded ratio condition for a certain plan year. based on information currently available to the company, the central states pension fund has not received notice of revocation of the ten-year amortization extension granted by the irs. in the unlikely event the irs were to revoke the extension, revocation would apply retroactively to the 2004 plan year, which would result in a material liability for abfs share of the resulting funded deficiency, the extent of which is currently unknown to the company.   other multiemployer pension plans in which abf participates have adopted or will have to adopt either a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program, depending on their current funded status as required by the ppa. we believe that the contribution rates under the current collective bargaining agreement will comply with any rehabilitation plan that has been or may be adopted by the majority of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. if the contribution rates in the collective bargaining agreement fail to meet the requirements established by the rehabilitation or funding improvement plan required by the ppa for underfunded plans, the ppa would impose additional contribution requirements in the form of a surcharge of an additional 5% to 10%. however, under our collective bargaining agreement which expires march 31, 2013, any surcharges that may be required by the ppa are covered by the contractual contribution rate and should not increase our overall contribution obligation. the plans trustees have the ability to take a wide range of actions to improve the funded status of the plans which include adopting an automatic five-year extension of the amortization period available under the ppa; requesting an additional five-year extension from the irs; obtaining changes to or waivers of the requirements used by the plans to calculate funded levels; or modifying pension benefits.     17 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   the underfunded status of many plans in which we participate developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved. we believe that the trustees of these funds will take appropriate measures to fulfill their fiduciary duty to preserve the integrity of the plans, or in certain cases, to extend the solvency of the funds by utilizing a combination of several possible initiatives as they have done in the past, although we cannot make any assurances in this regard. the trustees of the central states pension fund concluded for the rehabilitation plan effective december 31, 2010, that imposing additional contribution increases in the current economic environment could risk irreparable harm to the financial condition of many contributing employers, thereby adversely impacting their ability to continue to make contributions to fund the pension plans. any changes to scheduled contribution rate increases through march 31, 2013 under our current collective bargaining agreement would be subject to approval by the bargaining parties. while increasing employer contributions has historically served as a potential remedy to address the underfunded status, other alternatives that may be pursued by the trustees of underfunded plans include establishing a minimum retirement age, reducing or eliminating certain adjustable benefits of the plan or redesigning the plan structure. furthermore, additional legislative changes or action taken by governmental agencies could provide relief.   as previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. in 2009, certain contributing competitors of abf were granted concessions from the ibt which allowed for the suspension of multiemployer pension plan contributions for the eighteen-month period ending december 31, 2010. in 2010, this suspension was extended until june 1, 2011, at which time pension contributions are scheduled to resume at a significantly lower rate. the reduction of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities and our future contribution requirements.   ongoing claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   our self-insurance retention levels are currently $1.0 million for each workers compensation loss, $1.0 million for each cargo loss and generally $1.0 million for each third-party casualty loss. effective february 1, 2010, our self-insurance retention levels for medical benefits increased from $175,000 to $225,000 per person, per claim year. we maintain insurance for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. if the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. the timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared to prior periods. significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, current and future federal and state regulation and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. in addition, if we were to lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.   we are required by certain states in which we are self-insured to provide letters of credit as collateral for workers compensation and third-party casualty claims liabilities, and we have a program in place with an insurance carrier for the issuance of surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program. we have agreements with four financial institutions to provide collateralized facilities for the issuance of letters of credit, which require cash or short-term investments to be pledged as collateral for the outstanding letters of credit. our surety bonds are also collateralized by restricted short-term investments in certificates of deposit. estimates made by the states and the insurance carrier of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.   increased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.   our recent insurance renewals did not result in significant changes in premiums; however, insurance carriers may increase premiums for many companies, including transportation companies, in the coming years. we could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. if our insurance or claims expenses were to increase and we were unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected.     18 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   market penetration of our service and growth initiatives may take longer than anticipated.   the level of revenues expected to be generated from our development of second-day service lanes, next-day lanes and same-day service offerings may be impacted by actions of our competitors and by general economic conditions. maintaining and developing these services requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure. depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from these service initiatives, as well as other service offerings that supplement our motor carrier freight operations, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional offerings may not be achieved.   we may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions.   we evaluate acquisition candidates from time to time and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business. acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. the degree of success of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends in part upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. the possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers and key employees; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications and other systems; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. the diversion of the attention of management from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions.   our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that are beyond our control.   we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards. however, they are still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and similar events. to mitigate the potential for such occurrences at our corporate headquarters, we have implemented various systems, including redundant telecommunication facilities; a fire suppression system to protect our on-site data center; and electrical power protection and generation facilities. we have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and alternate processing capability which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully operational within 48 hours. this plan provides for work space, telephones and desktop computers for basic operations within 48 hours of a catastrophe that renders our corporate headquarters unusable. an emergency communications web site has also been constructed to provide information to our employees and customers during such a disaster. we have business interruption insurance, including, in certain circumstances, insurance against terrorist attacks under the federal terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe. however, a significant system failure, security breach, disruption by a virus or other damage could still interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation and cause a loss of customers.   our results of operations can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions.   we can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels. freight shipments, operating costs and earnings can also be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and, consequently, our operating results.   our financial statements may be impacted by future changes in accounting rules and requirements.   future changes in accounting rules and disclosure requirements could significantly impact our reported financial results and the comparability of financial statements. there are numerous new accounting proposals under development by the standard setting bodies which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial statements, including the     19 table of contents   item 1a.        risk factors  continued   recognition of revenue, accounting for leases and disclosures related to our participation in multiemployer plans. furthermore, a conversion from u.s. generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we account for, disclose and present various aspects of our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. potential future changes in accounting rules and regulations could be time-consuming and costly to implement.   we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:   ·                  any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings;   ·                  widespread outbreak of an illness or communicable disease or public health crisis; and   ·                  operational or market disruptions, including infrastructure damage, increases in costs of supplies or significant declines in demand for our services arising from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, and from illegal acts, including terrorist attacks.   our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties.   item 1b.
