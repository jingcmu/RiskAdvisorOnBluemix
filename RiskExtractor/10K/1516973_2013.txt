item 1a.  risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before making a decision to purchase our securities. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. if that happens, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our investing, portfolio management and financing activities we operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and more established competitors may be able to compete more effectively for investment opportunities than we can. this competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could affect the pricing of these investments. a number of entities compete with us to make investments. we compete with other reits and public and private funds, including those that may be managed by affiliates of american capital, such as american capital agency corp., commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. our competitors may be larger and may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. some competitors may have a lower cost of funds than we do or access to funding sources that may not be available to us. many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with reit tax compliance and maintenance of an exemption from the investment company act. in addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which may allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. furthermore, competition for investments in mortgage-related investments may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. the competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we may not be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. our board of directors has approved very broad investment guidelines for our manager and will not approve each investment and financing decision made by our manager. our manager is authorized to follow very broad investment guidelines that may be amended from time-to-time. our board of directors periodically reviews our investment guidelines and our investment portfolio but does not, and will not be required to, review all of our proposed investments on an individual basis. in conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors relies primarily on information provided to it by our manager. furthermore, our manager may use complex strategies and transactions that may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind if our board of directors determines that they are not consistent with our investment guidelines. in addition, because our manager has a certain amount of discretion in investment, financing and hedging decisions, our manager's decisions could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 we may experience significant short-term gains or losses and, consequently, greater earnings volatility as a result of our active portfolio management strategy. our manager employs an active management strategy on our behalf to achieve our principal objective of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. our active management strategy involves buying and selling financial instruments in all sectors of the mortgage market, including fixed-rate and adjustable-rate agency mortgage investments, cmos, non-agency mortgage investments, cmbs, whole loans and mortgage-related derivatives based on our manager's continual assessment of the relative risk/return of those investments. therefore, the composition of our investment portfolio will vary as our manager believes changes to market conditions, risks and valuations warrant. consequently, we may experience significant investment gains or losses when we sell investments that our manager no longer believes provide attractive risk-adjusted returns or when our manager believes more attractive alternatives are available. with an active management strategy, our manager may be incorrect in its assessment of our investment portfolio and select an investment portfolio that could generate lower returns than a more static management strategy. also, investors are less able to assess the changes in our valuation and performance by observing changes in the mortgage market since we may have changed our strategy and portfolio from the last publicly available data. we may also experience fluctuations in leverage as we pursue our active management strategy. our strategy involves significant leverage, which increases the risk that we may incur substantial losses. we expect our leverage to vary with market conditions and our assessment of risk/return on investments. we incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our assets. by incurring this leverage, we could enhance our returns. nevertheless, this leverage, which is fundamental to our investment strategy, also creates significant risks. because of our significant leverage, we may incur substantial losses if our borrowing costs increase. our borrowing costs may increase for any of the following reasons: • short-term interest rates increase; • the market value of our investments decreases; • the "haircut" applied to our assets under the repurchase agreements we are party to increases; • interest rate volatility increases; or • the availability of financing in the market decreases. the non-agency mortgage loans in which we invest and that underlie the non-agency mbs in which we invest may be subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in significant losses to us. residential mortgage loans are secured by residential property and those that are not guaranteed by a u.s. government agency or gse are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss. the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower. a number of factors may impair borrowers' abilities to repay their loans, including: acts of god; acts of war or terrorism; adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of complying with such laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as mold; and the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses. commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of residential property. the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. if the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by, among other things: tenant mix; success of tenant businesses; property management decisions; property location and condition; competition from comparable types of properties; changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged; any need to address environmental contamination at the property; the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property; changes in national, regional or local economic conditions or specific industry segments; declines in regional or local real estate values; declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; increases in interest rates; real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; acts of god, acts of war or terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances. in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which 18 could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan. rmbs evidence interests in, or are secured by, pools of residential mortgage loans. cmbs evidence interests in, or are secured by, a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans. accordingly, the mortgage-backed securities in which we may invest may be subject to all of the risks of the respective underlying mortgage loans. the failure of servicers to service effectively the mortgage loans underlying the rmbs in our investment portfolio or any mortgage loans we own would materially and adversely affect us. most securitizations of residential mortgage loans require a servicer to manage collections on each of the underlying loans. both default frequency and default severity of loans may depend upon the quality of the servicer. if servicers are not vigilant in encouraging borrowers to make their monthly payments, the borrowers may be far less likely to make these payments, which could result in a higher frequency of default. if servicers take longer to liquidate non-performing assets, loss severities may tend to be higher than originally anticipated. additionally, servicers can perform loan modifications, which could potentially be detrimental to the value of our securities. the failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying the rmbs in our investment portfolio or any mortgage loans we own could negatively impact the value of our investments and our performance. servicer quality is of prime importance in the default performance of rmbs. if a servicer goes out of business the transfer of servicing takes time and loans may become delinquent because of confusion or lack of attention. when servicing is transferred, servicing fees may increase, which may have an adverse effect on the credit support of rmbs held by us. in the case of pools of securitized loans, servicers may be required to advance interest on delinquent loans to the extent the servicer deems those advances recoverable. in the event the servicer does not advance funds, interest may be interrupted even on more senior securities. servicers may also advance more than is in fact recoverable once a defaulted loan is disposed, and the loss to the trust may be greater than the outstanding principal balance of that loan (greater than 100% loss severity). we may not control the special servicing of the mortgage loans included in the cmbs in which we may invest and, in such cases, the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interests. with respect to each series of cmbs in which we may invest, overall control over the special servicing of the related underlying mortgage loans will be held by a "directing certificateholder" or a "controlling class representative," which is appointed by the holders of the most subordinate class of cmbs in such series. depending on the class of cmbs we may acquire, we may not have the right to appoint the directing certificateholder. in connection with the servicing of the specially-serviced mortgage loans, the related special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificateholder, take actions with respect to the specially-serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect our interests. our investments may benefit from private mortgage insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses. in certain instances, non-agency mortgage loans may have private insurance. this insurance is often structured to absorb only a portion of the loss if a loan defaults and, as such, we may be exposed to losses on these loans in excess of the insured portion of the loans. the private mortgage insurance industry has been adversely affected by the housing market decline and this may limit an insurer's ability to perform on its insurance. lastly, rescission and denial of mortgage insurance may affect our ability to collect on our insurance. if private mortgage insurers fail to remit insurance payments to us for insured portions of loans when losses are incurred and where applicable, whether due to breach of contract or to an insurer's insolvency, we may experience a loss for the amount that was insured by such insurers, though we may maintain claims against the insurers. our investments may include subordinated tranches of rmbs or cmbs, which are subordinate in right of payment to more senior securities. our investments may include subordinated tranches of rmbs or cmbs, which are subordinated classes of securities in a structure of securities collateralized by a pool of mortgage loans and, accordingly, are the first or among the first to bear the loss upon a restructuring or liquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal. additionally, estimated fair values of these subordinated interests tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior securities. as a result, such subordinated interests generally are not actively traded and may not provide holders thereof with liquid investments. 19 investments in non-investment grade rmbs or cmbs may be illiquid, may have a higher risk of default and may not produce current returns. we may invest in rmbs or cmbs that are non-investment grade, which means that major rating agencies rate them below the top four investment-grade rating categories (i.e., "aaa" through "bbb"). non-investment grade rmbs and cmbs bonds and preferred shares tend to be less liquid, may have a higher risk of default and may be more difficult to value than investment grade bonds. recessions or poor economic or pricing conditions in the markets associated with rmbs or cmbs may cause defaults or losses on loans underlying such securities. non-investment grade securities are considered speculative, and their capacity to pay principal and interest in accordance with the terms of their issue is not certain. any credit ratings assigned to our investments will be subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded. some of our investments are rated by moody's investors service, fitch ratings or standard & poor's. any credit ratings on our investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. if rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of these investments could significantly decline, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. our manager's due diligence of potential investments may not reveal all of the potential liabilities associated with such investments and may not reveal other weaknesses in such investments, which could lead to investment losses. before making an investment, our manager assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the originators, borrowers and the underlying property values, as well as other factors and characteristics that are material to the performance of the investment. in making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, our manager relies on resources available to it and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. there can be no assurance that our manager's due diligence process will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful. we may be adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the asset or property types in which our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions. our assets are not subject to any geographic, diversification or concentration limitations, except that we expect our assets to be concentrated in mortgage-related investments. accordingly, our investment portfolio may be concentrated by geography, asset, property type and/or borrower, increasing the risk of loss to us if the particular concentration in our investment portfolio is subject to greater risks or undergoing adverse developments. in addition, adverse conditions in the areas where the properties securing or otherwise underlying our investments are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) and local real estate conditions (such as oversupply or reduced demand) may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments. a material decline in the demand for real estate in these areas may materially and adversely affect us. lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks among our investments. we may invest in non-prime mortgage loans or investments collateralized by non-prime mortgage loans, which are subject to increased risks. we may invest in non-prime mortgage loans or investments collateralized by pools of non-prime mortgage loans. in general, non-prime mortgage loans are loans that have been originated using underwriting standards that do not conform to agency underwriting guidelines. these lower standards include mortgage loans made to borrowers having imperfect or impaired credit histories, mortgage loans where the amount of the loan at origination is 80% or more of the value of the mortgage property, mortgage loans made to borrowers with low credit scores, mortgage loans made to borrowers who have other debt that represents a large portion of their income and mortgage loans made to borrowers whose income is not required to be disclosed or verified. due to economic conditions, including increased interest rates and lower home prices, as well as aggressive lending practices, non-prime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss, and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner. thus, because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with non-prime mortgage loans, the performance of non-prime mortgage loans or investments backed by non-prime mortgage loans in which we may invest could be correspondingly adversely affected, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. 20 the federal conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between these agencies and the u.s. government, may adversely affect our business to the extent that we own agency mortgage investments. the payments of principal and interest we receive on the agency mortgage investments in which we may invest are guaranteed by fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. fannie mae and freddie mac are gses, but their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. ginnie mae is part of a u.s. government agency and its guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. in response to general market instability and, more specifically, the financial conditions of fannie mae and freddie mac, in july 2008, the housing and economic recovery act of 2008, or hera, established fhfa as the new regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac. in september 2008, the u.s. treasury, the fhfa and the u.s. federal reserve announced a comprehensive action plan to help stabilize the financial markets, support the availability of mortgage financing and protect taxpayers. under this plan, among other things, the fhfa was appointed as conservator of both fannie mae and freddie mac, allowing the fhfa to control the actions of the two gses, without forcing them to liquidate, which would be the case under receivership. importantly, the primary focus of the plan was to increase the availability of mortgage financing by allowing these gses to continue to grow their guarantee business without limit, while limiting the size of their retained mortgage and agency security portfolios and requiring that these portfolios be reduced over time. although the u.s. government has committed to support the positive net worth of fannie mae and freddie mac, the two gses could default on their guarantee obligations, which would materially and adversely affect the value of our agency securities. accordingly, if these government actions are inadequate and the gses continue to suffer losses or cease to exist, our business, operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that we own agency mortgage investments. in addition, the problems faced by fannie mae and freddie mac resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant u.s. government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the u.s. government in providing liquidity for mortgage loans. the future roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements. any such changes to the nature of their guarantee obligations could re-define what constitutes an agency security and could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition. we could be negatively affected in a number of ways depending on the manner in which related events unfold for fannie mae and freddie mac. we rely on our mortgage-related investments, including agency mortgage investments, as collateral for our financings. any decline in the value of agency mortgage investments, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, would make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or to maintain our compliance with the terms of any financing transactions for such investments. further, the current support provided by the u.s. treasury to fannie mae and freddie mac, and any additional support it may provide in the future, could have the effect of lowering the interest rates we expect to receive from agency mortgage investments, thereby tightening the spread between the interest we earn on our agency mortgage investments and the cost of financing those assets. a reduction in the supply of agency mortgage investments could also negatively affect the pricing of agency mortgage investments by reducing the spread between the interest we earn on our investment portfolio of agency mortgage investments and our cost of financing that portfolio. as indicated above, recent legislation has changed the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. government. future legislation could further change the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. government, and could also nationalize, privatize, or eliminate such entities entirely. any law affecting these gses may create market uncertainty and have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac. as a result, such laws could increase the risk of loss on our investments in agency mortgage investments guaranteed by fannie mae and/or freddie mac. it also is possible that such laws could adversely impact the market for such securities and spreads at which they trade. all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. purchases and sales of agency securities by the federal reserve may adversely affect the price or return associated with agency mortgage-backed securities. on september 13, 2012, the federal reserve announced their third quantitative easing program, commonly known as qe3, and extended their guidance to keep the federal funds rate at "exceptional low levels" through at least mid-2015. qe3 entails large-scale purchases of agency mbs at the pace of $40 billion per month in addition to the federal reserve's existing 21 policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency mbs into new agency mbs purchases. while we cannot predict the impact of this program or any future actions by the federal reserve on the prices and liquidity of agency mbs, we expect that during periods in which the federal reserve purchases significant volumes of agency mbs, yields on agency mbs securities will be lower and refinancing volumes will be higher than would have been absent their large scale purchases. as a result, returns on agency mbs may be adversely affected. there is also a risk that the federal reserve may reduce their purchases of agency mbs or decide to sell some or all of their holdings of agency mbs, which could adversely affect the pricing of our agency mbs portfolio. mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and our returns on, residential mortgage-backed securities. the u.s. government, through the u.s. federal reserve, the fha, and the federal deposit insurance corporation, has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including the home affordable modification program, or hamp, which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, the hope for homeowners program, or h4h program, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fha-insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and the home affordable refinance program, or harp, which for loans sold or guaranteed by the gses on or prior to may 31, 2009, allows borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments to refinance and reduce their monthly mortgage payments, with no current loan-to-value ratio upper limit and without requiring new mortgage insurance. hamp, the h4h program and other loss mitigation programs may involve, among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or the extension of payment terms of the loans. especially with non-agency securities, a significant number of loan modifications with respect to a given security, including, but not limited to, those related to principal forgiveness and coupon reduction, resulting in increased prepayment rates, could negatively impact the realized yields and cash flows on such security. these loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, residential mortgage-backed securities that we may purchase. actions of the u.s. government, including the u.s. congress, u.s. federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies, to stabilize or reform the financial markets may not achieve the intended effect and may adversely affect our business. in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions, the emergency economic stabilization act, or eesa, was enacted by the u.s. congress in 2008. there can be no assurance that the eesa or any other u.s. government actions will have a beneficial impact on the financial markets. to the extent the markets do not respond favorably to any such actions by the u.s. government or such actions do not function as intended, our business may not receive the anticipated positive impact from the legislation and such result may have broad adverse market implications. in july 2010, the u.s. congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, or the dodd-frank act, in part to impose significant investment restrictions and capital requirements on banking entities and other organizations that are significant to u.s. financial markets. for instance, the dodd-frank act imposes significant restrictions on the proprietary trading activities of certain banking entities and subjects other systemically significant organizations regulated by the u.s. federal reserve to increased capital requirements and quantitative limits for engaging in such activities. the dodd-frank act also seeks to reform the asset-backed securitization market (including the mortgage-backed securities market) by requiring the retention of a portion of the credit risk inherent in the pool of securitized assets and by imposing additional registration and disclosure requirements. certain of the new requirements and restrictions exempt agency securities, other government issued or guaranteed securities, or other securities. nonetheless, the dodd-frank act also imposes significant regulatory restrictions on the origination of residential mortgage loans and will impact the formation of new issuances of non-agency securities. the dodd-frank act has also created a new regulator, the consumer financial protection bureau, or the cfpb, which now oversees many of the core laws which regulate the mortgage industry, including among others, the real estate settlement procedures act and the truth in lending act. while the full impact of the dodd-frank act and the role of the cfpb cannot be assessed until all implementing regulations are released, the dodd-frank act's extensive requirements may have a significant effect on the financial markets, and may affect the availability or terms of financing from our lender counterparties and the availability or terms of mortgage-backed securities, both of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 22 in addition, the u.s. government, federal reserve, u.s. treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what effect, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. to the extent that we invest in agency mortgage investments that are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac, we are subject to the risk that these gses may not be able to satisfy fully their guarantee obligations or that these guarantee obligations may be repudiated, which may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities. the interest and principal payments we receive on the agency mortgage investments in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. unlike the ginnie mae certificates in which we invest, the principal and interest on securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are not explicitly guaranteed by the u.s. government. all the agency securities in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the securities. as conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac, the fhfa may disaffirm or repudiate contracts (subject to certain limitations for qualified financial contracts) that freddie mac or fannie mae entered into prior to the fhfa's appointment as conservator if it determines, in its sole discretion, that performance of the contract is burdensome and that disaffirmation or repudiation of the contract promotes the orderly administration of its affairs. the hera requires the fhfa to exercise its right to disaffirm or repudiate most contracts within a reasonable period of time after its appointment as conservator. fannie mae and freddie mac have disclosed that the fhfa has disaffirmed certain consulting and other contracts that these entities entered into prior to the fhfa's appointment as conservator. freddie mac and fannie mae have also disclosed that the fhfa has advised that it does not intend to repudiate any guarantee obligation relating to fannie mae and freddie mac's mortgage-related securities, because the fhfa views repudiation as incompatible with the goals of the conservatorship. in addition, the hera provides that mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets that have been transferred to a freddie mac or fannie mae securitization trust must be held for the beneficial owners of the related mortgage-related securities, and cannot be used to satisfy the general creditors of freddie mac or fannie mae. if the guarantee obligations of freddie mac or fannie mae were repudiated by fhfa, payments of principal and/or interest to holders of agency securities issued by freddie mac or fannie mae would be reduced in the event of any borrower's late payments or failure to pay or a servicer's failure to remit borrower payments to the trust. in that case, trust administration and servicing fees could be paid from mortgage payments prior to distributions to holders of agency securities. any actual direct compensatory damages owed due to the repudiation of freddie mac or fannie mae's guarantee obligations may not be sufficient to offset any shortfalls experienced by holders of agency securities. fhfa also has the right to transfer or sell any asset or liability of freddie mac or fannie mae, including its guarantee obligation, without any approval, assignment or consent. if fhfa were to transfer freddie mac or fannie mae's guarantee obligations to another party, holders of agency mortgage investments would have to rely on that party for satisfaction of the guarantee obligation and would be exposed to the credit risk of that party. changes in the underwriting standards by freddie mac or fannie mae could have an adverse impact on agency mortgage investments in which we may invest or make it more difficult to acquire attractive non-agency mortgage investments. in april 2010, freddie mac and fannie mae announced tighter underwriting guidelines for arms and hybrid interest-only arms in particular. specifically, freddie mac announced that it would no longer purchase interest-only mortgages and fannie mae changed its eligibility criteria for purchasing and securitizing arms to protect consumers from potentially dramatic payment increases. our targeted investments include adjustable-rate mortgages and hybrid arms. tighter underwriting standards by freddie mac or fannie mae could reduce the supply of arms, resulting in a reduction in the availability of the asset class. more lenient underwriting standards could also substantially reduce the supply and attractiveness of non-agency opportunities. we may be affected by deficiencies in foreclosure practices of third parties, as well as related delays in the foreclosure process. deficiencies in foreclosure documentation by, among others, several large mortgage servicers have raised various concerns relating to foreclosure practices, and a group consisting of state attorneys general and state bank and mortgage regulators in all 50 states and the district of columbia has been reviewing foreclosure practices in their various jurisdictions. a number of mortgage servicers temporarily suspended foreclosure proceedings in some or all states in which they do business while they reviewed and made modifications to their foreclosure practices. any extension of foreclosure timelines can increase the inventory backlog of distressed homes on the market and creates greater uncertainty about housing prices. prior to making investments in rmbs or residential whole loans, we expect our manager to carefully consider many factors, including housing prices and foreclosure timelines, and estimate loss assumptions. the concerns about deficiencies in foreclosure practices of 23 servicers and related delays in the foreclosure process may impact our loss assumptions and affect the values of, and our returns on, our investments in rmbs and residential whole loans. market conditions have disrupted the historical relationship between interest rate changes and prepayment trends, which make it more difficult for our manager to analyze our investment portfolio. our success depends, in part, on our manager's ability to analyze the relationship of changing interest rates on prepayments of the mortgage loans that we may own or that underlie securities we may own. changes in interest rates and prepayments affect the market price of the assets that we purchase and any assets that we may hold at a given time. as part of our overall portfolio risk management, our manager analyzes interest rate changes and prepayment trends separately and collectively to assess their effects on our investment portfolio. in conducting its analysis, our manager depends on certain assumptions based upon historical trends with respect to the relationship between interest rates and prepayments under normal market conditions. dislocations in the residential mortgage market and other developments may disrupt the relationship between the way that prepayment trends have historically responded to interest rate changes and, consequently, may negatively impact our manager's ability to (i) assess the market value of our investment portfolio, (ii) implement our hedging strategies and (iii) implement techniques to reduce our prepayment rate volatility, which could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. continued adverse developments in the broader residential mortgage market may adversely affect the value of our investments. since 2008, the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced a variety of unprecedented difficulties and changed economic conditions, including defaults, credit losses and liquidity concerns. many of these conditions are expected to continue in 2013 and beyond. certain commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies announced extensive losses from exposure to the residential mortgage market. these losses reduced financial industry capital, leading to reduced liquidity for some institutions. these factors have impacted investor perception of the risk associated with real estate related assets, including mortgage-related investments. as a result, values for these assets have experienced a certain amount of volatility. further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the assets in which we invest. the risks associated with our business are more severe during economic recessions and are compounded by declining real estate values. declining real estate values will likely reduce the level of new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase of additional properties. borrowers will also be less able to pay principal and interest on loans underlying the securities in which we invest if the value of residential real estate weakens further. further, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on rmbs and cmbs in which we intend to invest in the event of default because the value of collateral on the mortgages underlying such securities may be insufficient to cover the outstanding principal amount of the loan. any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from the mortgage-backed securities and whole loans in our investment portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. all of our investments are recorded at fair value, and quoted prices or observable inputs may not be available to determine such value, resulting in the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine value. the values of some of our investments may not be readily determinable. we measure the fair value of these investments quarterly, in accordance with guidance set forth in fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 820, fair value measurements and disclosures. the fair value at which our assets are recorded may not be an indication of their realizable value. ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond the control of our manager, our company or our board of directors. further, fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold since market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. if we were to liquidate a particular asset, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such asset is valued. accordingly, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected by our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments, whether in the applicable period or in the future. additionally, such valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time. in certain cases, our manager's determination of the fair value of our investments include inputs provided by third-party dealers and pricing services. valuations of certain investments in which we invest are often difficult to obtain or unreliable. in general, dealers and pricing services heavily disclaim their valuations. dealers may claim to furnish valuations only as an accommodation and without special compensation, and so they may disclaim any and all liability for any direct, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of any inaccuracy or incompleteness in valuations, including any act of 24 negligence or breach of any warranty. depending on the complexity and illiquidity of a security, valuations of the same security can vary substantially from one dealer or pricing service to another. therefore, our results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair market value of these investments are materially different than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. the valuation process has been particularly challenging recently as market events have made valuations of certain assets more difficult, unpredictable and volatile. declines in value of the assets in which we invest will adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, and make it more costly to finance these assets. we use our investments as collateral for our financings. any decline in their value, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, could make it difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place. our investments in mortgage-related securities are recorded at fair value under a fair value option election at the time of purchase with changes in fair value reported in earnings. as a result, a decline in fair values of our mortgage-related securities could reduce both our earnings and stockholders' equity. if market conditions result in a decline in the fair value of our assets, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. failure to procure adequate repurchase agreement financing or to renew or replace existing repurchase agreement financing as it matures (to which risk we are specifically exposed due to the short-term nature of the repurchase agreement financing we employ) would adversely affect our results of operations. we use debt financing as a strategy to increase our return on equity. however, we may not be able to achieve our desired leverage ratio for a number of reasons, including the following: • our lenders do not make repurchase or other financing agreements available to us at acceptable rates; • lenders with whom we enter into repurchase or other financing agreements subsequently exit the market for such financing; • our lenders require that we pledge additional collateral to cover our borrowings, which we may be unable to do; or • we determine that the leverage would expose us to excessive risk. we cannot assure you that any, or sufficient, financing will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us. in the event that we cannot obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, there may be a negative impact on the value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions, and you may lose part or all of your investment. furthermore, because we rely primarily on short-term borrowings, our ability to achieve our investment objective depends not only on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms, but also on our ability to renew or replace on a continuous basis our maturing short-term borrowings. if we are not able to renew or replace maturing borrowings, we may have to sell some or all of our assets, possibly under adverse market conditions. in addition, if the regulatory capital requirements imposed on our lenders change, they may be required to significantly increase the cost of the financing that they provide to us. our lenders also may revise their eligibility requirements for the types of assets they are willing to finance or the terms of such financings, based on, among other factors, the regulatory environment and their management of perceived risk, particularly with respect to assignee liability. pursuant to the terms of borrowings under master repurchase agreements, we are subject to margin calls that could result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions or through foreclosure. we enter into master repurchase agreements with a number of financial institutions. we borrow under certain of these master repurchase agreements to finance the assets for our investment portfolio. pursuant to the terms of borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, a decline in the value of the collateral may result in our lenders initiating margin calls. a margin call means that the lender requires us to pledge additional collateral to re-establish the ratio of the value of the collateral to the amount of the borrowing. the specific collateral value to borrowing ratio that would trigger a margin call is not set in the master repurchase agreements and is not determined until we engage in a repurchase transaction under these agreements. our fixed-rate collateral generally may be more susceptible to margin calls as increases in interest rates tend to affect more negatively the market value of fixed-rate securities. in addition, some collateral may be more illiquid than other instruments in which we invest, which could cause them to be more susceptible to margin calls in a volatile market environment. moreover, collateral that prepays more quickly increases the frequency and magnitude of potential margin calls as there is a significant time lag between when the prepayment is reported (which reduces the market value of the security) and when the principal payment is actually received. if we are unable to satisfy margin calls, our lenders may foreclose on our collateral. the threat of or occurrence of a margin call could force us to sell, either directly or through a foreclosure, our collateral under adverse market 25 conditions. because of the leverage we expect to have, we may incur substantial losses upon the threat or occurrence of a margin call. if lenders pursuant to our repurchase transactions default on their obligations to resell the underlying collateral back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the collateral has declined by the end of the term or if we default on our obligations under the transaction, we will lose money on these transactions. when we engage in a repurchase transaction, we initially transfer securities or loans to the financial institution under one of our master repurchase agreements in exchange for cash, and our counterparty is obligated to resell such assets to us at the end of the term of the transaction, which is typically from 30 to 120 days, but which may have terms from one day to 364 days. the cash we receive when we initially sell the collateral is less than the value of that collateral, which is referred to as the "haircut." as a result, we are able to borrow against a smaller portion of the collateral that we initially sell in these transactions. increased haircuts require us to post additional collateral. the haircut rates under our master repurchase agreements are not set until we engage in a specific repurchase transaction under these agreements. if our counterparty defaults on its obligation to resell collateral to us, we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could adversely affect our earnings, and, thus, our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction, the counterparty can terminate the transaction and cease entering into any other repurchase transactions with us. in that case, we would likely need to establish a replacement repurchase facility with another financial institution in order to continue to leverage our investment portfolio and carry out our investment strategy. we may not be able to secure a suitable replacement facility on acceptable terms or at all. further, financial institutions providing the repurchase agreements may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash uninvested or to set aside non-leveraged assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. as a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on equity. if we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly. additionally, our counterparties can unilaterally choose to cease entering into any further repurchase transactions with us. our rights under our repurchase agreements are subject to the effects of the bankruptcy laws in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of us or our lenders under the repurchase agreements. in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy, certain repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the u.s. bankruptcy code, the effect of which, among other things, would be to allow the lender under the applicable repurchase agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code and to foreclose on the collateral agreement without delay. in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a lender during the term of a repurchase agreement, the lender may be permitted, under applicable insolvency laws, to repudiate the contract, and our claim against the lender for damages may be treated simply as an unsecured creditor. in addition, if the lender is a broker or dealer subject to the securities investor protection act of 1970, or an insured depository institution subject to the federal deposit insurance act, our ability to exercise our rights to recover our assets under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender's insolvency may be further limited by those statutes. these claims would be subject to significant delay and, if and when received, may be substantially less than the damages we actually incur. increasing our exposure to the agency mortgage passthrough market in to be announced (tba) securities could adversely affect our financing costs if the dollar roll market weakens. historically, we have financed the majority of our securities on balance sheet through the repurchase (repo) market. with the introduction of qe3, implied financing rates through the dollar roll market are significantly cheaper in certain coupons relative to repo financing rates. given attractive mortgage roll financing, we may enter into and maintain a significantly larger tba forward commitment position than has been typical in the past. in periods of high stress and poor liquidity, such as the crisis of 2008, dollar rolls can be negatively impacted by a lack of demand and available balance sheet. if, for example, the new york federal reserve abruptly stops the qe3 program in mortgage securities, implied financing levels may no longer be attractive and mortgages may underperform hedges. in the event a situation like this does occur, we may either take delivery or sell the tba forward contracts. it may be uneconomical to "roll" our tba dollar roll transactions or we may be unable to meet margin calls on our tba contracts, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 26 we may utilize tba dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing agency mortgage-backed securities. tba contracts enable us to purchase or sell, for future delivery, agency securities with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular agency securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the tba settlement date. prior to settlement of the tba contract we may choose to move the settlement of the securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting position (referred to as a "pair off"), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing a similar tba contract for a later settlement date, collectively referred to as a “dollar roll.” the agency securities purchased for a forward settlement date under the tba contract are typically priced at a discount to agency securities for settlement in the current month. this difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” the price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency securities over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost) and is commonly referred to as "dollar roll income." consequently, dollar roll transactions and such forward purchases of agency securities represent a form of off-balance sheet financing and increase our "at risk" leverage. under certain market conditions, tba dollar roll transactions may result in negative carry income whereby the agency securities purchased for a forward settlement date under the tba contract are priced at a premium to agency securities for settlement in the current month. under such conditions, it would generally be uneconomical to roll our tba positions prior to the settlement date and we could have to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and settle our obligations for cash. we may not have sufficient funds or alternative financing sources available to settle such obligations. in addition, pursuant to the margin provisions established by the mortgage-backed securities division ("mbsd") of the fixed income clearing corporation we are subject to margin calls on our tba contracts. further, our prime brokerage agreements may require us to post additional margin above the levels established by the mbsd. negative carry income on tba dollar roll transactions or failure to procure adequate financing to settle our obligations or meet margin calls under our tba contracts could result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions or through foreclosure and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. an increase in our borrowing costs would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. increases in interest rates reduce the difference, or spread, that we may earn between the yield on the investments we make and the cost of the leverage we employ to finance such investments. an increase in short-term interest rates would increase the amount of interest owed on the short-term financing arrangements we enter into to finance the purchase of the assets, such as repurchase agreements. it is possible that the spread on investments could be reduced to a point at which the profitability from investments would be significantly reduced. this would adversely affect our returns on our assets, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to liquidate certain or all of our assets. the lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. we may invest in securities, whole loans or other instruments that are not liquid or that could become illiquid. it may be difficult or impossible to obtain third party valuations on these investments and these instruments typically experience greater price volatility than instruments for which a ready market exists. in addition, validating pricing for these instruments may be more subjective than more liquid investments. the lack of liquidity for certain asset classes that we may invest in may make it difficult for us to sell such investments should the need or desire arise. in addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our investment portfolio quickly, we may realize significant losses. as a result, our ability to change our investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions may be limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, recent legislation and regulations, could limit certain market participants' abilities to make markets in certain securities, including non-agency securities. these rules have the potential to significantly reduce the liquidity within these markets, making it more difficult for us to sell such investments and may significantly impact the price volatility of the asset class. differences in timing of interest rate adjustments on adjustable-rate assets or the tenor of fixed rate assets we acquire and our borrowings may adversely affect our profitability. assets we acquire may have interest rates that vary over time based upon changes in an objective index, such as: •  libor, which is the interest rate that banks in london offer for deposits in london of u.s. dollars; or • the treasury rate, which is a monthly or weekly average yield of benchmark u.s. treasury securities, as published by the federal reserve board. these indices generally reflect short-term interest rates but these assets may not reset in a manner that matches our borrowings. in addition, we may rely primarily on short-term borrowings to acquire securities or loans with long-term maturities. the relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the "yield curve." 27 ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. if short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates (a flattening of the yield curve), our borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. because our investments generally bear interest at longer-term rates than we pay on our borrowings, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our investment portfolio. additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease our net income. it is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve inversion), in which event, our borrowing costs may exceed our interest income and we could incur operating losses and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be hindered. interest rate caps on mortgages backing our adjustable rate securities may adversely affect our profitability. adjustable-rate mortgages that we may purchase or that may back securities that we purchase will typically be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during any given period. lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through the maturity of a mortgage loan we may purchase or that may back securities that we may purchase. our borrowings typically will not be subject to similar restrictions. accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps on mortgages could limit the interest rates on our investments in arms. this problem is magnified for hybrid arms and arms that are not fully indexed. further, some hybrid arms and arms may be subject to periodic payment caps on the mortgages that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. as a result, we may receive less cash income on hybrid arms and arms than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. these factors could reduce our net interest income and cause us to suffer a loss. an increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the volume of newly issued, or investor demand for, mortgages, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire assets that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends, while a decrease in interest rates may cause an increase in the volume of newly issued, or investor demand for, mortgages, which could negatively affect the valuations for our investments and may adversely affect our liquidity. a reduction in the volume of mortgage loans originated may affect the volume of investments available to us, which could affect our ability to acquire assets that satisfy our investment objectives. an increase in the volume of mortgage loans originated may negatively impact the valuation for our investment portfolio. a negative impact on valuations of our assets could have an adverse impact on our liquidity profile in the event that we are required to post margin under our repurchase agreements, which could materially and adversely impact our business. because we may invest in fixed-rate assets, an increase in interest rates on our borrowings may adversely affect our book value or our net interest income. increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our investments. any fixed-rate securities or loans we invest in generally will be more negatively affected by these increases than adjustable-rate securities or loans. in accordance with gaap, we are required to reduce the book value of our investments by the amount of any decrease in their fair value. reductions in the fair value of our investments could decrease the amounts we may borrow to purchase additional mortgage-related investments, which may restrict our ability to increase our net income. furthermore, if our funding costs are rising while our interest income is fixed, our net interest income will contract and could become negative. changes in prepayment rates may adversely affect our profitability. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by pools of mortgage loans. for securities backed by pools of mortgage loans, we receive payments, generally, from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans. when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans at rates that are faster or slower than expected, it results in prepayments that are faster or slower than expected on our assets. these faster or slower than expected payments may adversely affect our profitability. we may purchase securities or loans that have a higher interest rate than the then prevailing market interest rate. in exchange for this higher interest rate, we may pay a premium to par value to acquire the security or loan. in accordance with gaap, we amortize this premium over the expected term of the security or loan based on our prepayment assumptions. if a security or loan is prepaid in whole or in part at a faster than expected rate, however, we must expense all or a part of the remaining unamortized portion of the premium that was paid at the time of the purchase, which will adversely affect our profitability. we also may purchase securities or loans that have a lower interest rate than the then prevailing market interest rate. in exchange for this lower interest rate, we may pay a discount to par value to acquire the security or loan. we accrete this 28 discount over the expected term of the security or loan based on our prepayment assumptions. if a security or loan is prepaid at a slower than expected rate, however, we must accrete the remaining portion of the discount at a slower than expected rate. this will extend the expected life of our investment portfolio and result in a lower than expected yield on securities and loans purchased at a discount to par. prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. prepayments can also occur when borrowers sell the property and use the sale proceeds to prepay the mortgage as part of a physical relocation or when borrowers default on their mortgages and the mortgages are prepaid from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale of the property. fannie mae and freddie mac will generally, among other conditions, purchase mortgages that are 120 days or more delinquent from mortgage-backed securities trusts when the cost of guarantee payments to security holders, including advances of interest at the security coupon rate, exceeds the cost of holding the nonperforming loans in their portfolios. consequently, prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets, which may result in increased delinquencies on mortgage loans, the government-sponsored entities cost of capital, general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed and adjustable rate loans, which could lead to an acceleration of the payment of the related principal. additionally, changes in the government-sponsored entities' decisions as to when to repurchase delinquent loans can materially impact prepayment rates. in addition, the introduction of new government programs could increase the availability of mortgage credit to a large number of homeowners in the united states, which we expect would impact the prepayment rates for the entire mortgage securities market, but primarily for fannie mae and freddie mac agency securities. these new programs along with any new additional programs or changes to existing programs may cause substantial uncertainty around the magnitude of changes in prepayment speeds. to the extent that actual prepayment speeds differ from our expectations, it could adversely affect our operating results. changes in credit spreads may adversely affect our profitability. we invest in securities and may invest in loans that are exposed to credit risk. a significant component of the fair value of these instruments is attributable to the difference between the value of a financial instrument of a similar maturity with no credit risk, such as a u.s. treasury note, and our investments, or the credit spread. credit spreads are subject to market factors and have been volatile in recent years. in addition, hedging fair value changes associated with credit spreads can be inefficient. since the fair value of our investments impacts both our statement of operations and stockholders' equity, credit spread changes may adversely affect our profitability. our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating the risks associated with changes in interest rates. subject to complying with reit tax requirements, we employ techniques that limit, or "hedge," the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our short-term repurchase agreements and may hedge changes in credit spreads on our credit sensitive assets and our net book value. in general, our hedging strategy depends on our manager's view of our entire investment portfolio, consisting of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments, in light of prevailing market conditions. our hedging activities are generally designed to limit certain exposures and not to eliminate them. in addition, they may be unsuccessful and we could misjudge the condition of our investment portfolio or the market. our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates and principal repayments, credit market conditions, the type of assets held and other changing market conditions. our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our currently anticipated hedging strategy. these techniques may include entering into interest rate swap agreements, interest rate swaptions, tbas, short sales, caps, collars, floors, forward contracts, options, futures, credit default swaps or other types of hedging transactions. we may conduct certain hedging transactions through a trs, which may subject those transactions to federal, state and, if applicable, local income tax. there are no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate and credit hedging may fail to protect us from loss. additionally, our business model calls for accepting certain amounts of credit, interest rate, prepayment, liquidity, and other exposures and thus some risks will generally not be hedged. alternatively, our manager may fail to properly assess a risk to our investment portfolio or may fail to recognize a risk entirely, leaving us exposed to losses without the benefit of any offsetting hedging activities. the derivative financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our risk. the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. poorly designed hedging strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. in addition, hedging activities could result in losses if the event against which we hedge does not occur. for example, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things: • interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates; 29 • available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; • the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability; • the amount of income that a reit may earn from hedging transactions other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain requirements of the internal revenue code or that are done through a trs to offset interest rate losses is limited by federal tax provisions governing reits; • as explained in further detail in the risk factor immediately below, the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay; • the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and • the value of derivatives used for hedging are adjusted from time to time in accordance with gaap to reflect changes in fair value, with downward adjustments, or "mark-to-market losses," reducing our stockholders' equity. our hedging strategies may adversely affect us because hedging activities involve costs that we incur regardless of the effectiveness of the hedging activity. those costs may be higher in periods of market volatility, both because the counterparties to our derivative agreements may demand a higher payment for taking risks, and because repeated adjustments of our hedges during periods of interest rate changes also may increase costs. we could incur significant hedging-related costs without any corresponding economic benefits, especially if our hedging strategies are not effective. our use of certain hedging techniques may expose us to certain risks. hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any u.s. or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses. the cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and, during periods of rising and volatile interest rates, we may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs. in addition, hedging instruments involve risk because they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any u.s. or foreign governmental authorities. consequently, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the domicile of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. if a swap counterparty under an interest rate swap agreement that we enter into as part of our hedging strategy cannot perform under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we may not receive payments due under that agreement, and, thus, we may lose any potential benefit associated with the interest rate swap. the same is true of a counterparty in a credit default swap transaction. additionally, we may also risk the loss of any collateral we have pledged to secure our obligations under these swap agreements if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy. similarly, if an interest rate cap counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the interest rate cap agreement, in addition to not receiving payments due under that agreement that would off-set our interest expense, we could also incur a loss for all remaining unamortized premium paid for that security. pursuant to the terms of our master swap agreements, we are subject to margin calls that could result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions or through foreclosure. certain of our master swap agreements (governed by the international swaps and derivatives association, inc., or isda) require that we post initial collateral upon execution of swap agreements. in addition, our master swap agreements contain provisions under which we are required to collateralize fully our obligations under the derivative instrument, such that if at any point the fair value of the derivative represents a liability greater than the minimum transfer amount contained within our agreement, the counterparty may initiate a margin call for the difference. if we fail to satisfy the margin call, we will be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination values. further, our master swap agreements may also contain cross default provisions under which a default under certain of our other indebtedness in excess of a certain threshold amount causes an event of default under the agreement. following an event of default, we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination values. the threat of or occurrence of margin calls or the forced settlement of our obligations under our master swap agreements at their termination values could force us to sell, either directly or through a foreclosure, our investments under adverse market conditions. because of the leverage we have, we may incur substantial losses upon the threat or occurrence of either of these events. 30 we may change our targeted investments, investment guidelines and other operational policies without stockholder consent, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. we may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments described herein. our board of directors also determines our other operational policies and may amend or revise such policies, including our policies with respect to our reit qualification, acquisitions, dispositions, operations, indebtedness and distributions, or approve transactions that deviate from these policies, without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. a change in our targeted investments, investment guidelines and other operational policies may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, all of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. we may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title. in the course of our business, we may take title to real estate, and, if we do take title, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. in such a circumstance, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. we may not be able to invest in mortgage loans if we do not obtain required licensing and regulator approval. we intend to obtain the required licensing and regulator approval to allow us to be able to invest in mortgage loans. however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner to allow us to invest in mortgage loans. risks related to our relationship with our manager and american capital there are conflicts of interest in our relationship with our manager and american capital. because we have no employees, our manager is responsible for making all of our investment decisions. certain of our and our manager's officers are employees of american capital or its affiliates and these persons do not devote their time exclusively to us. our manager's investment committee consists of messrs. wilkus, erickson, flax, kain, winkler and mchale, each of whom is an officer of american capital or the parent company of our manager and has significant responsibilities to american capital and certain of its portfolio companies, affiliated entities or managed funds. mr. kain is our president and chief investment officer and also serves as the president of our manager and as the president and a member of its parent company. mr. kain is also the president and chief investment officer of american capital agency corp. and the president of its manager. thus, he has, and may in the future have, significant responsibilities for other funds that are managed by the parent company of our manager or entities affiliated therewith. in addition, because certain of our and our manager's officers are also responsible for providing services to american capital and/or certain of its portfolio companies, affiliated entities or managed funds, they may not devote sufficient time to the management of our business operations. additionally, our manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of american capital mortgage management, llc, which is also the parent company of the external manager of american capital agency corp., a publicly-traded reit that invests exclusively in agency mortgage investments (other than for limited investments entered into for hedging purposes) and may compete with us for acquisitions of agency mortgage-related investments. american capital mortgage management, llc is a subsidiary of american capital asset management, llc, which is a portfolio company of american capital. there are no restrictions on american capital that would prevent american capital from sponsoring another investment vehicle that competes with us. accordingly, american capital or one or more of its affiliates may also compete with us for investments. although our manager and its affiliates have policies in place to seek to mitigate the effects of conflicts of interest, including any potential conflict relating to the allocation of certain types of securities that meet our investment objectives and those of other managed funds or affiliates of our manager, these policies do not eliminate the conflicts of interest that our officers and the officers and employees of our manager and its affiliates face in making investment decisions on behalf of american capital, any other american capital-sponsored investment vehicles and us. further, we do not have any agreement or understanding with american capital that would give us any priority over american capital, any of its affiliates, or any such american capital-sponsored investment vehicle in opportunities to invest in mortgage-related investments. accordingly, we may compete for access to the benefits that we expect from our relationship with our manager and american capital. 31 our management agreement was not negotiated on an arm's-length basis and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if they were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. the management agreement was originally negotiated between related parties, and we did not have the benefit of arm's-length negotiations of the type normally conducted with an unaffiliated third party. the terms of the management agreement, including fees payable, may not reflect the terms that we may have received if it were negotiated with an unrelated third party. in addition, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the management agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our manager. we are completely dependent upon our manager and certain personnel of american capital or the parent company of our manager who provide services to us through the management agreement and the administrative services agreement and we may not find suitable replacements for our manager and these personnel if the management agreement and the administrative services agreement are terminated or such personnel are no longer available to us. because we have no employees or separate facilities, we are completely dependent on our manager and its affiliates to conduct our operations pursuant to the management agreement. our manager does not have any employees and relies upon certain employees of its parent company and american capital to conduct our day-to-day operations pursuant to an administrative services agreement. under the administrative services agreement, our manager is provided with those services and resources necessary for our manager to perform its obligations and responsibilities under the management agreement in exchange for certain fees payable by our manager. neither the administrative services agreement nor the management agreement require our manager or its parent company or american capital to dedicate specific personnel to our operations. it also does not require any specific personnel of our manager or its parent company or american capital to dedicate a specific amount of time to our business. additionally, because our manager is relying upon american capital, we may be negatively impacted by events or factors that negatively impact american capital's business, financial condition or results of operations. if we terminate the management agreement without cause, we may not, without the consent of our manager, employ any employee of the manager or any of its affiliates, including american capital, or any person who has been employed by our manager or any of its affiliates at any time within the two-year period immediately preceding the date on which the person commences employment with us for two years after such termination of the management agreement. we believe that the successful implementation of our investment, financing and hedging strategies depends upon the experience of certain of american capital and our manager's officers. american capital or the parent company of our manager has entered into retention agreements with certain of these officers. however, none of these individuals' continued service is guaranteed. furthermore, if the management agreement is terminated or these individuals leave the parent company of our manager or american capital, we may be unable to execute our business plan. we have no recourse to american capital if it does not fulfill its obligations under the administrative services agreement. neither we nor our manager have any employees or separate facilities. our day-to-day operations are conducted by employees of american capital or the parent company of our manager pursuant to an administrative services agreement among our manager, its parent company and american capital. under the administrative services agreement, our manager is also provided with the services and other resources necessary for our manager to perform its obligations and responsibilities under the management agreement in exchange for certain fees payable by our manager. although the administrative services agreement may not be terminated unless the management agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms, american capital and the parent company of our manager may assign their rights and obligations thereunder to any of their affiliates, including american capital asset management, llc, the majority member of the parent company of our manager. in addition, because we are not a party to the administrative services agreement, we do not have any recourse to american capital or the parent company of our manager if they do not fulfill their obligations under the administrative services agreement or if they elect to assign the agreement to one of their affiliates. also, our manager only has nominal assets and we will have limited recourse against our manager under the management agreement to remedy any liability to us from a breach of contract or fiduciary duties. if we elect not to renew the management agreement without cause, we would be required to pay our manager a substantial termination fee. these and other provisions in our management agreement make non-renewal of our management agreement difficult and costly. electing not to renew the management agreement without cause would be difficult and costly for us. with the consent of the majority of the independent members of our board of directors, we may elect not to renew our management agreement upon the expiration of any automatic annual renewal term, upon 180-days prior written notice. if we elect not to renew the management agreement because of a decision by our board of directors that the management fee is unfair, our manager has the right to renegotiate a mutually agreeable management fee. if we elect to not renew the management agreement without cause, 32 we are required to pay our manager a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by our manager during the prior 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed month prior to the effective date of termination. these provisions may increase the effective cost to us of electing to not renew the management agreement. our manager's management fee is based on the amount of our equity and is payable regardless of our performance. our manager is entitled to receive a monthly management fee from us that is based on the amount of our equity (as defined in our management agreement), regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. for example, we would pay our manager a management fee for a specific period even if we experienced a net loss during the same period. the amount of the monthly management fee is equal to one-twelfth of 1.50% of our equity and therefore is only increased by increases in our equity. increases to our equity will primarily result from equity issuances, which could result in a conflict of interest between our manager and our stockholders with respect to the timing and terms of our equity issuances. while our stockholders bear the risk of our future equity issuances reducing the price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us, the compensation payable to our manager will increase as a result of future issuances of our equity securities. our manager's entitlement to substantial nonperformance-based compensation may reduce its incentive to devote sufficient time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio. this in turn could harm our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. our manager's liability is limited under the management agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our manager against certain liabilities. the management agreement provides that our manager will not assume any responsibility other than to provide the services specified in the management agreement. the agreement further provides that our manager is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. in addition, our manager and its respective affiliates, managers, officers, directors, employees and members will be held harmless from, and indemnified by us against, certain liabilities on customary terms. our results are dependent upon the efforts of our manager. our manager's success, which is largely determinative of our own success, depends on many factors, including the availability of attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities that satisfy our targeted investment strategies and then identifying and consummating them on favorable terms, the level and volatility of interest rates, its ability to access on our behalf short-term and long-term financing on favorable terms and conditions in the financial markets, real estate market and the economy, as to which no assurances can be given. in addition, our manager may face substantial competition for attractive investment opportunities. our manager may not be able to successfully cause us to make investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. although we do not intend to request a ruling from the irs as to our reit qualification, we have received an opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp with respect to our qualification as a reit. investors should be aware, however, that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or any court. the opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp represents only the view of our counsel based on our counsel's review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us and our manager, including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income. the opinion is expressed as of the date issued and does not cover subsequent periods. skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp has no obligation to advise us or the holders of our common stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in applicable law. furthermore, both the validity of the opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp, and our qualification as a reit depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis, the results of which will not be monitored by skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp. our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. our compliance with the annual reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the reit qualification requirements as described below. 33 accordingly, there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or in securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit requirements. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. unless we were entitled to relief under certain internal revenue code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit. distributions payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. the maximum tax rate applicable to income from "qualified dividends" payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. distributions of ordinary income payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or distributions payable by reits, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock. reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit qualification requirements of the internal revenue code. from time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. for example, we may be required to accrue income from mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. we may also acquire discounted debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. if such arrangements constitute "significant modifications" of such debt under the applicable treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower, with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to modification. as a result, we may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements in certain circumstances. in particular, where we experience differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, in order to comply with reit requirements, or (iv) make taxable distributions of our capital stock or debt securities. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive. we may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to certain non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a 34 significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, excise taxes, state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes, and other taxes. in addition, in order to meet the reit qualification requirements, prevent the recognition of certain types of non-cash income, or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory, we may hold some of our assets through our trs or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates. in addition, if we lend money to a trs, the trs may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to us, which could result in an even higher corporate level tax liability. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts that we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit. in addition, in certain cases, the modification of a debt instrument or, potentially, an increase in the value of a debt instrument that we acquired at a significant discount, could result in the conversion of the instrument from a qualifying real estate asset to a wholly or partially non-qualifying asset that must be contributed to a trs or disposed of in order for us to qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make and, in certain cases, to maintain ownership of, certain attractive investments. complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. to remain qualified as a reit, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified reit real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mbs. the remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. in addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more trss. if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. as a result, we may be required to liquidate from our investment portfolio otherwise attractive investments. for example, in certain cases, the modification of a debt instrument or, potentially, an increase in the value of a debt instrument that we acquired at a significant discount, could result in the conversion of the instrument from a qualifying real estate asset to a wholly or partially non-qualifying asset that must be liquidated in order for us to qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit. these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. the failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. we enter into certain financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. economically, these agreements are financings that are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. we believe that we would be treated for reit asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. it is possible, however, that the irs could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to remain qualified as a reit. we may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. 35 we acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. the discount at which such debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectibility rather than current market interest rates. the amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as "market discount" for federal income tax purposes. accrued market discount is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made. if we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions. some of the debt instruments that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. we will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such debt instruments will be made. if such debt instruments or mbs turn out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectibility is provable. in addition, we may acquire debt instruments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. if the amendments to the outstanding instrument are "significant modifications" under the applicable treasury regulations, the modified instrument will be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower. in that event, we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified instrument exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified instrument, even if the value of the instrument or the payment expectations have not changed. following such a taxable modification, we would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its principal amount for federal tax purposes. finally, in the event that any debt instruments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectibility. similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to debt instruments at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectible. in each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter. distributions to tax-exempt investors may be classified as unrelated business taxable income. neither ordinary nor capital gain distributions with respect to our common stock nor gain from the sale of common stock should generally constitute unrelated business taxable income to a tax-exempt investor. however, there are certain exceptions to this rule. in particular: • part of the income and gain recognized by certain qualified employee pension trusts with respect to our common stock may be treated as unrelated business taxable income if shares of our common stock are predominantly held by qualified employee pension trusts, and we are required to rely on a special look-through rule for purposes of meeting one of the reit ownership tests, and we are not operated in a manner to avoid treatment of such income or gain as unrelated business taxable income; • part of the income and gain recognized by a tax-exempt investor with respect to our common stock would constitute unrelated business taxable income if the investor incurs debt in order to acquire the common stock; • part or all of the income or gain recognized with respect to our common stock by social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans which are exempt from federal income taxation under the internal revenue code may be treated as unrelated business taxable income; and • to the extent that we are (or a part of us, or a disregarded subsidiary of ours, is) a "taxable mortgage pool," or if we hold residual interests in a remic, a portion of the distributions paid to a tax-exempt stockholder that is allocable to excess inclusion income may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. the "taxable mortgage pool" rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations. securitizations could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for federal income tax purposes. as a reit, so long as we own 100% of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool, we generally would not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool. certain categories of stockholders, however, such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses and certain tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their distribution income from us that is attributable to the taxable mortgage pool. in addition, to the extent that our stock is owned by tax-exempt "disqualified 36 organizations," such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of our income from the taxable mortgage pool. in that case, we will reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose stock ownership gave rise to the tax. moreover, we would be precluded from selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. these limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions. to the extent we invest in construction loans, we may fail to remain qualified as a reit if the irs successfully challenges our estimates of the fair market value of land improvements that will secure those loans. we may invest in construction loans, the interest from which will be qualifying income for purposes of the reit income tests, provided that the loan value of the real property securing the construction loan is equal to or greater than the highest outstanding principal amount of the construction loan during any taxable year. for purposes of construction loans, the loan value of the real property is the fair market value of the land plus the reasonably estimated cost of the improvements or developments (other than personal property), which will secure the loan and which are to be constructed from the proceeds of the loan. there can be no assurance that the irs would not successfully challenge our estimate of the loan value of the real property and our treatment of the construction loans for purposes of the reit income and assets tests, which may cause us to fail to remain qualified as a reit. the failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset could adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. we may acquire mezzanine loans, for which the irs has provided a safe harbor but not rules of substantive law. pursuant to the safe harbor, if a mezzanine loan meets certain requirements, it will be treated by the irs as a real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the reit 75% income test. we may acquire mezzanine loans that do not meet all of the requirements of this safe harbor. in the event we own a mezzanine loan that does not meet the safe harbor and the irs successfully challenges such loan's treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset and income tests, then we could fail to remain qualified as a reit. liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification or create additional tax liability for us. to remain qualified as a reit, we must comply with requirements regarding the composition of our assets and our sources of income. if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the internal revenue code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. any income from a properly designated hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets generally does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trs. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, losses in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs. uncertainty exists with respect to the treatment of our tbas for purposes of the reit asset and income tests. we purchase and sell agency securities through tbas and recognize income or gains from the disposition of those tbas, through dollar roll transactions or otherwise, and may continue to do so in the future. while there is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of tbas as real estate assets or government securities for purposes of the 75% asset test or the qualification of income or gains from dispositions of tbas as gains from the sale of real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) or other qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, we treat our tbas as qualifying assets for purposes of the reit asset tests, and we treat income and gains from our tbas as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, based on an opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom 37 llp substantially to the effect that (i) for purposes of the reit asset tests, our ownership of a tba should be treated as ownership of the underlying agency securities, and (ii) for purposes of the 75% reit gross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our tbas should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the underlying agency securities. opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs, and no assurance can be given that the irs will not successfully challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions. in addition, it must be emphasized that the opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp is based on various assumptions relating to our tbas and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our tbas. no assurance can be given that the irs would not assert that such assets or income are not qualifying assets or income. if the irs were to successfully challenge the opinion of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp, we could be subject to a penalty tax or we could fail to remain qualified as a reit if a sufficient portion of our assets consists of tbas or a sufficient portion of our income consists of income or gains from the disposition of tbas. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to remain qualified as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans, which would be treated as prohibited transactions for federal income tax purposes. net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. the term "prohibited transaction" generally includes a sale or other disposition of property (including mortgage loans, but other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us. we might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a prohibited transaction for federal income tax purposes. we intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) at the reit level will be treated as, or as having been, held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business. as a result, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the reit level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. in addition, whether property is held "primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business" depends on the particular facts and circumstances. no assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the internal revenue code that would prevent such treatment. the 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a trs or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates. we intend to structure our activities to avoid prohibited transaction characterization. new legislation or administrative or judicial action, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit. the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs and the u.s. treasury department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us. risks related to our business structure loss of our exemption from regulation pursuant to the investment company act would adversely affect us. we conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act in reliance on the exemption provided by section 3(c)(5)(c) of the investment company act. section 3(c)(5)(c), as interpreted by the staff of the sec, requires that: (i) at least 55% of our investment portfolio consist of "mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate," or "qualifying real estate interests," and (ii) at least 80% of our investment portfolio consist of qualifying 38 real estate interests plus "real estate-related assets." in satisfying this 55% requirement, based on pronouncements of the sec staff, we may treat whole pool agency securities as qualifying real estate interests. the sec staff has not issued guidance with respect to whole pool non-agency securities. however, based on our own judgment and analysis of the sec's pronouncements with respect to agency whole pool certificates, we may also treat whole pool non-agency securities as qualifying real estate interests. we may also treat whole mortgage loans that we acquire directly as qualifying real estate interests provided that 100% of the loan is secured by real estate when we acquire it and we have the unilateral right to foreclose on the mortgage. although the sec staff has not issued guidance with respect to investments in controlling classes of cmbs, we may also treat certain investments in the controlling classes of cmbs pools as qualifying real estate interests. we currently intend to treat agency partial pool rmbs and non-agency partial pool rmbs as real estate-related assets. the mortgage related investments that we acquire are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. if the sec determines that any of these securities are not qualifying interests in real estate or real estate-related assets, adopts a contrary interpretation with respect to these securities or otherwise believes we do not satisfy the above exceptions or changes its interpretation of the above exceptions, we could be required to restructure our activities or sell certain of our assets. we may be required at times to adopt less efficient methods of financing certain of our mortgage related investments and we may be precluded from acquiring certain types of higher yielding securities. the net effect of these factors would be to lower our net interest income. if we fail to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced. our business will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to qualify for this exemption from regulation pursuant to the investment company act. in august 2011, the sec solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to section 3(c)(5)(c), including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage reits should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. there can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the investment company act status of reits, including the guidance of the division of investment management of the sec regarding this exemption, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. if we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the investment company act, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company (which, among other things, would require us to comply with the leverage constraints applicable to investment companies), any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for shares of our common stock. we are highly dependent on information and communications systems. any systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our operations and the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems. any failure or interruption of our or our manager's systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or our failure to comply with those laws or regulations may adversely affect our business. we are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal level, including securities and tax laws and financial accounting and reporting standards. these laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations or the failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business. certain of these laws and regulations pertain specifically to reits. risks related to our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile. the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and be subject to wide fluctuations. in addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to these companies' operating performances. if the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at a gain. we cannot assure you that the market price of our 39 common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include: • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions; • changes in our earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the real estate or specialty finance industry; • increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield; • changes in market valuations of similar companies; • adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future; • issuance of additional equity securities; • actions by institutional stockholders; • additions or departures of key management personnel, or changes in our relationship with our manager or american capital; • speculation in the press or investment community; and • general market and economic conditions. future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. in the future, we may raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities. upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock, if any, and lenders with respect to other borrowings will be entitled to our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. thus holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us. future sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our shares. we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sales on the market price of our common stock. any sales of a substantial number of our shares in the public market, or the perception that sales might occur, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future. we intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year is distributed to our stockholders. we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and the amount of our dividend will fluctuate. our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein. all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, the requirements for reit qualification and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. we may not be able to make distributions in the future or our board of directors may change our dividend policy in the future. in addition, some of our distributions may include a return of capital. to the extent that we decide to pay dividends in excess of our current and accumulated tax earnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. a return of capital reduces the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock to the extent of such basis and is treated as capital gain thereafter. an increase in market interest rates may cause a material decrease in the market price of our common stock. one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates. if the market price of our common stock is 40 based primarily on the earnings and return that we derive from our investments and income with respect to our investments and our related distributions to stockholders, and not from the market value of the investments themselves, then interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions are likely to affect adversely the market price of our common stock. for instance, if market rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate, the market price of our common stock could decrease as potential investors may require a higher distribution yield on our common stock or seek other securities paying higher distributions or interest. in addition, rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our variable rate debt, thereby reducing cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions. certain provisions in our charter and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. provisions in our charter and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. for example, our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, each without any vote or action by our stockholders. we could issue a series of preferred stock to impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt. these and other provisions in our charter and bylaws may impede takeover attempts, or other transactions, that may be in the best interests of our stockholders and, in particular, our common stockholders. in addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that provisions of our charter and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts, or other transactions, that our stockholders may favor. our charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding stock which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company. in order for us to remain qualified as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a reit. subject to certain exceptions, our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and 9.8%, in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our stock. the constructive ownership rules under the internal revenue code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being "closely held" under section 856(h) of the internal revenue code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or our capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company. certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law, or mgcl, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests. subject to certain limitations, provisions of the mgcl prohibit certain business combinations between us and an "interested stockholder" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who beneficially owned 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock during the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) or an affiliate of the interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. after the five-year period, business combinations between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of the interested stockholder must generally either provide a minimum price to our stockholders (as defined in the mgcl) in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder or be recommended by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our outstanding shares of voting stock and at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by stockholders other than the interested stockholder and its affiliates and associates. these provisions of the mgcl relating to business combinations do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by our board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and american capital and its affiliates, and between us and any other person, provided that in the latter case the 41 business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). however, our board of directors may repeal or modify this resolution at any time in the future, in which case the applicable provisions of this statute will become applicable to business combinations between us and interested stockholders. the "control share" provisions of the mgcl provide that holders of "control shares" of a maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a "control share acquisition" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of "control shares") have no voting rights with respect to such shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquiror of control shares, our officers and our employees who are also our directors. our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. additionally, title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to elect to be subject to certain provisions relating to corporate governance that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders' best interests. we are subject to some of these provisions, either by provisions of our charter and bylaws unrelated to subtitle 8 or by reason of an election in our charter to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8. our board of directors has the power to cause us to issue additional shares of our stock without stockholder approval. our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. in addition, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. as a result, our board of directors may establish a series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. item
