item 1a.    risk factors risk factors         you should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. the risks set out below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. if any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in such case, the net asset value of our common stock and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks relating to our business capital markets have recently been in a period of disruption and instability. these market conditions materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the united states, which had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our business and operations.         beginning in 2007, the u.s. capital markets entered into a period of disruption as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions. despite actions of the u.s. federal government, these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. while these conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that they will not worsen in the future. if these adverse market conditions return, we and other companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital in order to grow. equity capital may be difficult to raise because, subject to some limited exceptions, as a bdc, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. at our 2010 annual stockholders meeting, subject to certain determinations required to be made by our board of directors, our stockholders approved our ability to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock, not exceeding 25% of our then outstanding common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value per share during a period beginning on june 7, 2010 and expiring on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of our 2010 annual stockholders meeting and the date of our 2011 annual stockholders meeting. in addition, our ability to incur indebtedness (including by issuing preferred stock) is limited by applicable regulations such that our asset coverage, as defined in the investment company act, must equal at least 200% immediately after each time we incur indebtedness. the debt capital that will be available to us in the future, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than what we currently experience. any inability to raise capital could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.         moreover, market conditions similar to those experienced from 2007 through 2009 could make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.         given the recent extreme volatility and dislocation in the capital markets, many bdcs have faced, and may in the future face, a challenging environment in which to raise or access capital. at times during the recent significant changes in the capital markets, our ability to raise capital was affected and consequently the pace of our investment activity had slowed. in addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including the recent extreme volatility and disruption, has had, and may in the future 28 have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. while most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). as a result, volatility in the capital markets can adversely affect our investment valuations. further, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required. as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. an inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. a failure on our part to maintain our status as a bdc would significantly reduce our operating flexibility.         if we fail to maintain our status as a bdc, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the investment company act, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions and significantly decrease our operating flexibility. in addition, any such failure could cause an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. we are dependent upon certain key personnel of ares for our future success and upon their access to other ares' investment professionals.         we depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of certain key personnel of the ares global private debt group. we also depend, to a significant extent, on access to the investment professionals of other groups within ares and the information and deal flow generated by ares' investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. our future success depends on the continued service of the key personnel of the ares global private debt group. the departure of any of these individuals, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of ares, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we cannot assure you that ares capital management will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to ares' investment professionals or its information and deal flow. our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.         our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to acquire suitable investments and monitor and administer those investments, which depends, in turn, on our investment adviser's ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria.         accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of the structuring of our investment process and the ability of the investment adviser to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us. our executive officers and the members of our investment adviser's investment committee have substantial responsibilities in connection with their roles at ares and with the other ares funds, as well as responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement. they may also be called upon to provide significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. these demands on their time, which will increase as the number of investments grow, may distract them or slow the rate of investment. in order to grow, ares will need to hire, train, supervise, manage and retain new employees. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so effectively. any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.         in addition, as we grow, we may open up new offices in new geographic regions that may increase our direct operating expenses without corresponding revenue growth. 29 we may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the allied acquisition or it may take longer than anticipated to achieve such benefits.         on april 1, 2010, we consummated the allied acquisition. the realization of certain benefits anticipated as a result of the allied acquisition will depend in part on the continued integration of allied capital's investment portfolio and business with our investment portfolio and business. the dedication of management resources to the legacy allied portfolio may detract attention from our day-to-day business, including new origination activity, and there can be no assurance that there will not be material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations.         further, as a result of the allied acquisition, allied capital's equity investments, including equity investments larger than those we have traditionally made and controlled portfolio company equity investments, became part of our portfolio. we intend to actively seek opportunities over time to dispose of certain of the assets that were acquired in the allied acquisition, particularly non-yielding equity investments, as well as lower or non-yielding debt investments and investments that may not be core to our investment strategy, and generally rotate them into higher-yielding first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt investments. however, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations- portfolio and investment activity" for further information on the rotation and repositioning of investments acquired as part of the allied acquisition. our ability to grow depends on our ability to raise capital.         we will need to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments. we have elected to be treated as a ric and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the u.s. federal income tax treatment applicable to rics. among other things, in order to maintain our ric status, we must distribute to our stockholders on a timely basis generally an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, and, as a result, such distributions will not be available to fund investment originations. we must continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional securities to fund our growth. unfavorable economic or capital market conditions may increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or could result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. an inability to successfully access the capital markets could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and could decrease our earnings, if any.         in addition, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts or issue senior securities, such that our asset coverage, as defined in the investment company act, equals at least 200% immediately after such borrowing, which, in certain circumstances, may restrict our ability to borrow or issue debt securities or preferred stock. the amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our investment adviser's and our board of directors' assessments of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing or issuance of senior securities. we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current facilities, obtain other lines of credit or issue senior securities at all or on terms acceptable to us. regulations governing our operation as a bdc affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.         we may issue senior securities or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, up to the maximum amount permitted by the investment company act. under the provisions of the investment company act, we are permitted, as a bdc, to incur indebtedness or issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the investment company act, equals at least 200% after each such incurrence or issuance. if the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test, which may prohibit us from paying dividends and could prevent us from maintaining our status as a ric or may prohibit us from repurchasing shares of our common stock. in addition, our inability to satisfy this test could cause an event of default under our existing 30 indebtedness. if we cannot satisfy this test, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness. accordingly, any failure to satisfy this test could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. as of december 31, 2010, our asset coverage for senior securities was 321%.         we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. we may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. any such sale would be dilutive to the net asset value per share of our common stock. in any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any commission or discount). if our common stock trades at a discount to net asset value, this restriction could adversely affect our ability to raise capital.         at our 2010 annual stockholders meeting, subject to certain determinations required to be made by our board of directors, our stockholders approved our ability to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock, not exceeding 25% of our then outstanding common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value per share during a period beginning on june 7, 2010 and expiring on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of our 2010 annual stockholders meeting and the date of our 2011 annual stockholder meeting.         to generate cash for funding new investments, we have also securitized, and may in the future seek to securitize, our loans. to securitize loans, we may create a separate, wholly owned subsidiary and contribute or sell a pool of loans to such subsidiary (or one of its subsidiaries). such subsidiary may then sell equity, issue debt or sell interests in the pool of loans, on a limited-recourse basis, the payments on which are generally limited to the pool of loans and the proceeds therefrom. we may also retain a portion of the equity interests in the securitized pool of loans. any retained equity would be exposed to losses on the related pool of loans before any of the related debt securities. an inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy. the securitization market is subject to changing market conditions (including the recent, unprecedented dislocation of the securitization and finance markets generally) and we may not be able to access this market when we would otherwise deem appropriate. moreover, the successful securitization of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests may be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses. the investment company act may also impose restrictions on the structure of any securitization. we borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing with us.         borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. we currently borrow under our facilities and have issued or assumed other senior securities, and in the future may borrow from, or issue additional senior securities to, banks, insurance companies, funds, institutional investors and other lenders and investors. lenders and holders of such senior securities have fixed dollar claims on our consolidated assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders or any preferred stockholders. if the value of our consolidated assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value per share of our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not incurred leverage.         conversely, if the value of our consolidated assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not incurred leverage. similarly, any 31 increase in our consolidated income in excess of consolidated interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would had we not incurred leverage, while any decrease in our consolidated income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not incurred leverage. such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful.         as of december 31, 2010, we had $388.1 million in principal amount outstanding under our facilities, $155.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the clo notes (excluding the retained notes (as defined below)), $691.8 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the allied unsecured notes and $200 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2040 notes. in order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our december 31, 2010 total assets of at least 1.6%. the weighted average stated interest rate charged on our borrowings as of december 31, 2010 was 5.2%. we intend to continue borrowing under the facilities in the future and we may increase the size of the facilities or issue additional debt securities or other evidences of indebtedness (although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so). our ability to service our debt depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. the amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on our investment adviser's and our board of directors' assessments of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.         our facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities, including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a ric. a failure to renew our facilities or to add new or replacement debt facilities or issue additional debt securities or other evidences of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.         the following table illustrates the effect on return to a holder of our common stock of the leverage created by our use of borrowing at the weighted average stated interest rate of 5.2% as of december 31, 2010, together with (a) our total value of net assets as of december 31, 2010; (b) $1,435.1 million of principal indebtedness outstanding as of december 31, 2010 and (c) hypothetical annual returns on our portfolio of minus 15% to plus 15%. assumed return on portfolio (net of expenses)(1)     -15 %   -10 %   -5 %   0 %   5 %   10 %   15 % corresponding return to common stockholders(2)     -25 %   -17 %   -10 %   -2 %   5 %   13 %   20 % (1) the assumed portfolio return is required by regulation of the sec and is not a prediction of, and does not represent, our projected or actual performance. actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table. (2) in order to compute the "corresponding return to common stockholders," the "assumed return on portfolio" is multiplied by the total value of our assets at december 31, 2010 to obtain an assumed return to us. from this amount, the interest expense (calculated by multiplying the weighted average stated interest rate of 5.2% by the $1,435.1 million of principal debt) is subtracted to determine the return available to stockholders. the return available to stockholders is then divided by the total value of our net assets as of december 31, 2010 to determine the "corresponding return to common stockholders." 32 in addition to regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to raise capital, the facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes contain various covenants that, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.         the agreements governing the facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes require us to comply with certain financial and operational covenants. these covenants include:  restrictions on the level of indebtedness that we are permitted to incur in relation to the value of our assets;  restrictions on our ability to incur liens; and  maintenance of a minimum level of stockholders' equity.         as of the date of this annual report, we are in material compliance with the covenants of the facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes. however, our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. for example, depending on the condition of the public debt and equity markets and pricing levels, net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio may increase in the future. any such increase could result in our inability to comply with our obligation to restrict the level of indebtedness that we are able to incur in relation to the value of our assets or to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity.         accordingly, although we believe we will continue to be in compliance, there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with the covenants in the facilities, the clo notes, the unsecured notes and the 2016 convertible notes. failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility, the revolving funding facility, the clo notes, the unsecured notes or the 2016 convertible notes, that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the revolving credit facility, the purchasers under the revolving funding facility or the trustee or holders of the clo notes, the unsecured notes or the 2016 convertible notes, as applicable, could accelerate repayment under such indebtedness and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our credit ratings may change and as a result the cost and flexibility under our debt instruments may change.         as of december 31, 2010, we had a long-term counterparty credit rating from standard & poor's ratings service of "bbb," a long-term issuer default rating from fitch ratings of "bbb" and a long-term issuer rating from moody's investor service of "ba1." interest expense on our revolving credit facility and the revolving funding facility is based on a pricing grid that fluctuates depending on our credit ratings. there can be no assurance that our ratings will be maintained. if our ratings are downgraded, our cost of borrowing will increase.         in addition, if the ratings of our clo notes are downgraded, our ability to engage in certain transactions in respect of the investments held in the debt securitization, among other things, may under certain circumstances be restricted and certain principal proceeds may under certain circumstances be required to be used to further reduce the outstanding principal balance of the clo notes. there can be no assurance that the clo notes ratings will be maintained.         in addition, ratings agencies are required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices as a result of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), which president obama signed into law on july 21, 2010. there can be no assurance that such changes will not affect our ratings. 33 we operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.         a number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. we compete with other bdcs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, insurance companies, high yield investors, hedge funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. in addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the investment company act imposes on us as a bdc and that the code imposes on us as a ric. we cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to pursue attractive investment opportunities from time to time.         we do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer and we believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. rather, we compete with our competitors based on our existing investment platform, seasoned investment professionals, experience and focus on middle-market companies, disciplined investment philosophy, extensive industry focus and flexible transaction structuring. for a more detailed discussion of these competitive advantages, see "businesscompetitive advantages."         we may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. if we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss. as a result of operating in such a competitive environment, we may make investments that are on less favorable terms than what we may have originally anticipated, which may impact our return on these investments. we may be subject to certain corporate-level taxes regardless of whether we continue to qualify as a ric.         we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the u.s. federal income tax treatment applicable to rics. as a ric, we generally will not pay corporate-level u.s. federal income taxes on our income and gain that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends on a timely basis. to qualify as a ric, we must meet certain income source, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements (and will pay such tax on any undistributed income). we may also be subject to certain u.s. federal excise taxes, as well as state, local and foreign taxes.         the annual distribution requirement for a ric is satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on a timely basis generally an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income for each year. because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the investment company act and financial covenants under our indebtedness that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a ric. if we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a ric and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. because we must make distributions to our stockholders as described above, such amounts, to the extent a stockholder is not participating in our dividend reinvestment plan, will not be available to fund investment originations. we will be subject to corporate-level u.s. federal income tax on any undistributed income and/or gain.         to qualify as a ric, we must also meet certain annual income source requirements at the end of each taxable year and asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. failure to meet these tests may result in our having to (a) dispose of certain investments quickly or (b) raise 34 additional capital to prevent the loss of ric status. because most of our investments are in private companies and are generally illiquid, any such dispositions may be at disadvantageous prices and may result in losses. also, the rules applicable to our qualification as a ric are complex with many areas of uncertainty. accordingly, no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will qualify as a ric. if we fail to qualify as a ric for any reason and become subject to regular "c" corporation income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. the recently enacted "regulated investment company modernization act of 2010," which is effective for 2011 and later tax years, provides some relief from ric disqualification due to failures of the income source and asset diversification requirements, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. we cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the income source or asset diversification requirements. we may have difficulty paying our required distributions under applicable tax rules if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.         for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or pik interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. such original issue discount or increases in loan balances are included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. we also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash, including, for example, non-cash income from pik securities, deferred payment securities or hedging and foreign currency transactions.         since, in certain cases, we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the u.s. federal income tax requirement to distribute generally an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to maintain our status as a ric. accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. if we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a ric and thus be subject to additional corporate-level taxes. we may in the future determine to fund a portion of our investments with preferred stock, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss and the risks of investing in us in the same way as our borrowings.         because preferred stock is another form of leverage and the dividends on any preferred stock we issue must be cumulative, preferred stock has the same risks to our common stockholders as borrowings. payment of such dividends and repayment of the liquidation preference of such preferred stock must take preference over any dividends or other payments to our common stockholders, and preferred stockholders are not subject to any of our expenses or losses and are not entitled to participate in any income or appreciation in excess of their stated preference. we are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.         general interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our investment objective and rate of return on invested capital. because we borrow money and may issue debt securities or preferred stock to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay interest or dividends on such debt securities or preferred stock and the rate at which we invest these funds. as a result, there can be no 35 assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.         trading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to fall as interest rates rise. trading prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed-rate securities that have longer maturities. in the past, we have entered into certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, to mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, and we may do so again in the future. however, we cannot assure you that such transactions will be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk. hedging transactions may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.         although we have no policy governing the maturities of our investments, under current market conditions we expect that we will invest in a portfolio of debt generally having maturities of up to 10 years. this means that we are subject to greater risk (other things being equal) than a fund invested solely in shorter-term securities. a decline in the prices of the debt we own could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. many of our portfolio investments are not publicly traded and, as a result, the fair value of these investments may not be readily determinable.         a large percentage of our portfolio investments are not publicly traded. the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. we value these investments quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period. the valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 50% (based on value) of our valuations of portfolio companies without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm each quarter. however, we may use additional independent valuation firms to review the value of our investments more frequently, including in connection with the occurrence of significant events or changes in value affecting a particular investment. the types of factors that may be considered in valuing our investments include the enterprise value of the portfolio company (an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. our net asset value per share could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we realize upon disposition of such investments. the lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.         as we generally make investments in private companies, substantially all of these investments are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. in addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments. in addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or an affiliated manager of ares has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company. 36 we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.         we could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rates payable on the debt investments we make, the default rates on such investments, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. as a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. there are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns.         certain of our executive officers and directors, and members of the investment committee of our investment adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of other entities and affiliates of our investment adviser and investment funds managed by our affiliates. accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in our or our stockholders' best interests or that may require them to devote time to services for other entities, which could interfere with the time available to provide services to us. certain members of our investment adviser's investment committee have significant responsibilities for other ares funds. for example, messrs. ressler and rosenthal are required to devote a substantial majority of their business time to the affairs of acof. similarly, although the professional staff of our investment adviser will devote as much time to the management of the company as appropriate to enable our investment adviser to perform its duties in accordance with the investment advisory and management agreement, the professional staff of our investment adviser may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among the company, on the one hand, and investment vehicles managed by ares or one or more of its affiliates, on the other hand. these activities could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest insofar as the time and effort of the professional staff of our investment adviser and its officers and employees will not be devoted exclusively to the business of the company but will instead be allocated between the business of the company and the management of these other investment vehicles. however, ares believes that the efforts of such individuals are synergistic with and beneficial to the affairs of ares capital, acof and these other investment vehicles managed by ares or its affiliates.         in addition, certain ares funds may have investment objectives that compete or overlap with, and may from time to time invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by, ares capital. consequently, we, on the one hand, and these other entities, may from time to time pursue the same or similar capital and investment opportunities. ares capital management endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, and in any event consistent with any fiduciary duties owed to ares capital. nevertheless, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by investment managers affiliated with our investment adviser. in addition, there may be conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among us and the funds managed by us or one or more of our controlled affiliates, including iham, or among the funds they manage. we may or may not participate in investments made by funds managed by us or one or more of our controlled affiliates.         we have from time to time sold assets to certain funds managed by iham and, as part of our investment strategy, we may offer to sell additional assets to funds managed by us and/or one or more of our controlled affiliates (including iham) or we may purchase assets from funds managed by us and/or one or more of our controlled affiliates. in addition, funds managed by us or one or more of our controlled affiliates may offer assets to or may purchase assets from one another. while assets may be sold or purchased at prices that are consistent with those that could be obtained from third parties in the marketplace, and although these types of transactions generally require approval of one or more independent parties, there may be an inherent conflict of interest in such transactions between us and funds managed by us or one of our controlled affiliates. 37         we pay management and incentive fees to ares capital management, and reimburse ares capital management for certain expenses it incurs. in addition, investors in our common stock will invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments.         ares capital management's management fee is based on a percentage of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) and ares capital management may have conflicts of interest in connection with decisions that could affect our total assets, such as decisions as to whether to incur indebtedness or to make future investments.         the part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our pre-incentive fee net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that is accrued but not yet received in cash. if a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.         our investment advisory and management agreement renews for successive annual periods if approved by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not "interested persons" of the company as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the investment company act. however, both we and ares capital management have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. moreover, conflicts of interest may arise if our investment adviser seeks to change the terms of our investment advisory and management agreement, including, for example, the terms for compensation. while any material change to the investment advisory and management agreement must be submitted to stockholders for approval under the investment company act, we may from time to time decide it is appropriate to seek stockholder approval to change the terms of the agreement.         pursuant to our administration agreement, ares operations, an affiliate of ares capital management, furnishes us with administrative services and we pay ares operations at cost our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses (including travel expenses) incurred by ares operations in performing its obligations under our administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers (including our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, secretary and treasurer) and their respective staffs.         our portfolio company, iham, is party to the iham administration agreement with ares operations. pursuant to the iham administration agreement, our administrator provides iham with office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, and the services of certain personnel to perform research and related services, services of, and oversight of, custodians, depositories, accountants, attorneys, underwriters and such other persons in any other capacity deemed to be necessary. under the iham administration agreement, iham reimburses our administrator for all of the actual costs associated with such services, including its allocable portion of our administrator's overhead and the cost of our administrator's officers and respective staff in performing its obligations under the iham administration agreement. prior to entering into the iham administration agreement, iham was party to a services agreement with ares capital management, pursuant to which ares capital management provided similar services.         we recently entered into a new office lease that will expire in february 2026 pursuant to which we will lease new office facilities from a third party and start to pay rent in may 2011. we also entered into separate subleases with ares management and iham, pursuant to which ares management and iham will sublease approximately 15% and 20%, respectively, of the new office space, for a fixed rent equal to 15% and 20%, respectively, of the basic annual rent payable by us under the new office lease, plus certain additional costs and expenses. 38         as a result of the arrangements described above, there may be times when the management team of ares (including those members of management focused primarily on managing ares capital) have interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.         our stockholders may have conflicting investment, tax and other objectives with respect to their investments in us. the conflicting interests of individual stockholders may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of our investments, the structure or the acquisition of our investments, and the timing of dispositions of our investments. as a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by our investment adviser, including with respect to the nature or structuring of our investments, that may be more beneficial for one stockholder than for another stockholder, especially with respect to stockholders' individual tax situations. in selecting and structuring investments appropriate for us, our investment adviser will consider the investment and tax objectives of the company and our stockholders, as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objectives of any stockholder individually. changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations, such as the dodd-frank act, and any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain business practices of us or our portfolio companies, negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.         we and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws and regulations at the local, state, federal and, in some cases, foreign levels. these laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain business practices of us or our portfolio companies, negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.         on july 21, 2010, president obama signed into law the dodd-frank act. many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities. in particular, title iv of the dodd-frank act, the private fund investment advisers registration act of 2010 (the "advisers registration act"), becomes effective one year after the date of enactment and eliminates the "private adviser exemption" from sec registration currently contained in section 203(b)(3) of the advisers act. this provision exempted from registration investment advisers who do not hold themselves out to the public as investment advisers and have fewer than 15 clients. as a result, many investment advisers to private funds (with some exceptions) will be required to register with the sec and will become subject to substantial regulatory reporting and recordkeeping requirements regarding the private funds they advise. consequently, the advisers registration act will likely require our wholly owned portfolio company, iham, to register as an investment adviser under the advisers act. this would require iham to comply with the regulatory restrictions and obligations imposed on registered investment advisers generally. in addition, as a bdc, we are currently restricted in our ability to invest in a registered investment adviser.         we currently intend to seek relief from the sec to enable us to continue to invest in iham; however, there can be no assurance that such relief will be granted. if we are not able to obtain such relief, we may not be able to make future investments in iham, which could harm iham's business and the performance of our investment in iham. 39         while the impact of the dodd-frank act on us and our portfolio companies may not be known for an extended period of time, the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial services industry or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the u.s. congress, may negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies. our investment adviser's liability is limited under the investment advisory and management agreement, and we are required to indemnify our investment adviser against certain liabilities, which may lead our investment adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.         our investment adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the investment advisory and management agreement, and it will not be responsible for any action of our board of directors in declining to follow our investment adviser's advice or recommendations. pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement, our investment adviser and its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other person or entity affiliated with it will not be liable to us for their acts under the investment advisory and management agreement, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties. we have agreed to indemnify, defend and protect our investment adviser and its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other person or entity affiliated with it with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from acts of our investment adviser not arising out of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties under the investment advisory and management agreement. these protections may lead our investment adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. see "risk factorsrisks relating to our investmentsour investment adviser's incentive fee may induce ares capital management to make certain investments, including speculative investments." we may be obligated to pay our investment adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss.         our investment adviser is entitled to incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for that quarter (before deducting incentive compensation and certain other items) above a threshold return for that quarter. our pre-incentive fee net investment income for incentive compensation purposes excludes realized and unrealized capital losses or depreciation that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such capital losses or depreciation result in a net loss on our statement of operations for that quarter. thus, we may be required to pay our investment adviser incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net loss for that quarter.         under the investment advisory and management agreement, we will defer cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our investment adviser if, during the most recent four full calendar quarter periods ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 8.0% of our net assets at the beginning of such period. these calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. any deferred incentive fees will be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment can then be made under the investment advisory and management agreement. 40         if a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. our investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued income that we never receive as a result of a default on the obligation that resulted in the accrual of such income. we may not replicate ares' historical success and our ability to enter into transactions with ares and our other affiliates is restricted.         we cannot assure you that ares capital will replicate ares' historical success, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by other ares managed funds.         further, we and certain of our controlled affiliates are prohibited under the investment company act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our upstream affiliates, or our investment adviser and its affiliates, without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the sec. any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is our upstream affiliate for purposes of the investment company act and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than our securities) from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. the investment company act also prohibits "joint" transactions with an upstream affiliate, or our investment adviser or its affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our independent directors. in addition, we and certain of our controlled affiliates are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, or entering into joint transactions with, our investment adviser and its affiliates, or any person who owns more than 25% of our voting securities or is otherwise deemed to control, be controlled by, or be under common control with us, absent the prior approval of the sec through an exemptive order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance). the analysis of whether a particular transaction constitutes a joint transaction requires a review of the relevant facts and circumstances then existing.         we have applied for an exemptive order from the sec that would permit us and certain of our controlled affiliates to co-invest with funds managed by ares. any such order, if issued, will be subject to certain terms and conditions and there can be no assurance that such order will be granted by the sec. accordingly, we cannot assure you that we or our controlled affiliates will be permitted to co-invest with funds managed by ares, other than in the limited circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance or in the absence of a joint transaction. risks relating to our investments recent unprecedented declines in market prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets resulted in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio in the recent past, reducing our net asset value, and such conditions may occur again in the future.         as a bdc, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. we may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors. when an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent 41 equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. the effect of all of these factors on our portfolio reduced our net asset value at such time by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may suffer unrealized losses in future periods as well, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.         many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions (including the recent economic downturn that began in 2007 and slowdowns or recessions less severe) and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. therefore, during these periods our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our investments. adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. these events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results. we have recently experienced to some extent such effects during the recent economic downturn and may experience such effects again in the future.         a portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on its assets representing collateral for its obligations, which could trigger cross defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold and the value of any equity securities we own. we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. investments in privately held middle-market companies involve significant risks.         we primarily invest in privately held u.s. middle-market companies. investments in privately held middle-market companies involve a number of significant risks, including the following:  these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;  they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;  they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;  there is generally little public information about these companies. these companies and their financial information are not subject to the exchange act and other regulations that govern public companies, and we may be unable to uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed investment decision and cause us to lose money on our investments; 42  they generally have less predictable operating results and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;  our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies; and  they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs. our debt investments may be risky and we could lose all or part of our investment.         the debt that we invest in is typically not initially rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than "baa3" by moody's investors service, lower than "bbb-" by fitch ratings or lower than "bbb-" by standard & poor's rating service). indebtedness of below investment grade quality is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. therefore, our investments may result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. we also invest in assets other than first and second lien and mezzanine debt investments, including high-yield securities, u.s. government securities, credit derivatives and other structured securities and certain direct equity investments. these investments entail additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns.         in addition, to the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt will be subject to greater fluctuations in value based on changes in interest rates. also, such debt could subject us to phantom income, and since we generally do not receive any cash prior to maturity of the debt, the investment is of greater risk. investments in equity securities, many of which are illiquid with no readily available market, involve a substantial degree of risk.         we may purchase common and other equity securities. although common stock has historically generated higher average total returns than fixed income securities over the long-term, common stock also has experienced significantly more volatility in those returns and in recent years has significantly under performed relative to fixed income securities. the equity securities we acquire may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless and our ability to recover our investment will depend on our portfolio company's success. investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including:  any equity investment we make in a portfolio company could be subject to further dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity interests and to serious risks as a junior security that will be subordinate to all indebtedness (including trade creditors) or senior securities in the event that the issuer is unable to meet its obligations or becomes subject to a bankruptcy process;  to the extent that the portfolio company requires additional capital and is unable to obtain it, we may not recover our investment; and  in some cases, equity securities in which we invest will not pay current dividends, and our ability to realize a return on our investment, as well as to recover our investment, will be dependent on the success of the portfolio company. even if the portfolio company is successful, our ability to realize the value of our investment may be dependent on the occurrence of a liquidity event, such as a public offering or the sale of the portfolio company. it is likely to take a significant amount of time before a liquidity event occurs or we can otherwise sell our investment. in addition, the equity securities we receive or invest in may be subject to restrictions on resale during periods in which it could be advantageous to sell them. 43         there are special risks associated with investing in preferred securities, including:  preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer, at its discretion, to defer distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer. if we own a preferred security that is deferring its distributions, we may be required to report income for tax purposes before we receive such distributions;  preferred securities are subordinated to debt in terms of priority to income and liquidation payments, and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than debt;  preferred securities may be substantially less liquid than many other securities, such as common stock or u.s. government securities; and  generally, preferred security holders have no voting rights with respect to the issuing company, subject to limited exceptions.         additionally, when we invest in first and second lien senior loans or mezzanine debt, we may acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. however, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.         we may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the equity securities of investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the investment company act and in advisers to similar investment funds and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such company's expenses, including management and performance fees. we will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to ares capital management with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of such companies. with respect to each of these investments, each of our common stockholders will bear his or her share of the management and incentive fee of ares capital management as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any such investment funds or advisers.         as a result of the allied acquisition, allied capital's equity investments, including equity investments larger than those we have traditionally made and controlled portfolio company equity investments, became part of our portfolio. we intend to actively seek opportunities over time to dispose of certain of these investments and generally rotate them into higher-yielding first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt or other investments. however, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. there may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.         if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding as an equity investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. in addition, lenders can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them where they become too involved in the borrower's business or exercise control over the borrower. for example, we could become subject to a lender's liability claim, if, among other things, we actually render significant managerial assistance. 44 our portfolio companies may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.         our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt, or issue other equity securities, that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments. by their terms, such instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our investments. these debt instruments would usually prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under such debt. also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company typically are entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. after repaying such holders, the portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. in the case of securities ranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other security holders in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.         the rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing any junior priority loans we make to our portfolio companies may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that senior obligations are outstanding, we may forfeit certain rights with respect to the collateral to the holders of the senior obligations. these rights may include the right to commence enforcement proceedings against the collateral, the right to control the conduct of such enforcement proceedings, the right to approve amendments to collateral documents, the right to release liens on the collateral and the right to waive past defaults under collateral documents. we may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if as a result our rights as junior lenders are adversely affected. when we are a debt or minority equity investor in a portfolio company, we may not be in a position to exert influence on the entity, and stockholders and management of the company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.         when we make debt or minority equity investments, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree and the stockholders and management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. as a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment. our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged.         some of our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged, which may have adverse consequences to these companies and to us as an investor. these companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants and the leverage may impair these companies' ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. as a result, these companies' flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities may be limited. further, a leveraged company's income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money were not used. our investment adviser's incentive fee may induce it to make certain investments, including speculative investments.         the incentive fee payable by us to ares capital management may create an incentive for ares capital management to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. the way in which the incentive fee payable to our investment adviser is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of the return on 45 invested capital, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock. in addition, our investment adviser will receive the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. unlike the portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. as a result, our investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.         the part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our pre-incentive fee net investment income will be computed and paid on income that may include interest that is accrued but not yet received in cash. if a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. our investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on such accrued interest that we never actually receive.         because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may have to pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. for example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses. in addition, if market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for our investment adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. our investments in foreign companies may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in u.s. investments. we may also expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.         our investment strategy contemplates potential investments in foreign companies. investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in u.s. companies. these risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes (potentially at confiscatory levels), less liquid markets, less available information than is generally the case in the united states, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility.         although most of our investments will be u.s. dollar denominated, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us.         we have and may in the future enter into hedging transactions, which may expose us to risks associated with such transactions. we may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. use of these hedging instruments may include counter-party credit risk.         hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. 46 however, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.         the success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. in addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. in addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-u.s. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. see also "risk factorsrisk relating to our businesswe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates." the allied acquisition may have triggered certain "change of control" provisions and other restrictions in certain of our and allied capital's contracts and the failure to obtain any required consents or waivers could adversely impact us.         certain agreements of allied capital and ares capital or their controlled affiliates may have required a consent, amendment or waiver of one or more counterparties in connection with the allied acquisition. our failure to have obtained any such consent, amendment or waiver may permit such counterparties to terminate, or otherwise increase their rights or our obligations under, any such agreement because the allied acquisition may have violated an anti-assignment, change of control or other provision. as a result, we may have to seek to replace that agreement with a new agreement or seek a waiver or amendment to such agreement. we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace, amend or obtain a waiver under any such agreement on comparable terms or at all. risks relating to our common stock our shares of common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so again in the future, which could limit our ability to raise additional equity capital.         shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable to those shares. this characteristic of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share may decline. it is not possible to predict whether any shares of our common stock will trade at, above, or below net asset value. in the recent past, including during much of 2009, the stocks of bdcs as an industry, including at times shares of our common stock, traded below net asset value and at near historic lows as a result of concerns over liquidity, leverage restrictions and distribution requirements. when our common stock is trading below its net asset value per share, we will generally not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at its market price without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. at our 2010 annual stockholders meeting, subject to certain determinations required to be made by our board of directors, our stockholders approved our ability to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock, not exceeding 25% of our then outstanding common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value per share during a period beginning on june 7, 2010 and expiring on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of our 2010 annual stockholders meeting and the date of our 2011 annual stockholders meeting. 47 there is a risk that investors in our common stock may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time.         we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. if we declare a dividend and if more stockholders opt to receive cash distributions rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to sell some of our investments in order to make cash dividend payments.         in addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. further, if we invest a greater amount of assets in equity securities that do not pay current dividends, it could reduce the amount available for distribution. see "dividend/distribution policy." provisions of the maryland general corporation law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.         the maryland general corporation law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of ares capital or the removal of our directors. we are subject to the maryland business combination act, subject to any applicable requirements of the investment company act. our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the business combination act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. if the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board does not approve a business combination, the business combination act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. our bylaws exempt from the maryland control share acquisition act (the "control share acquisition act") acquisitions of our stock by any person. if we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the control share acquisition act, the control share acquisition act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.         we have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. these provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may discourage, delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. investing in our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk.         the investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive and, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.         the capital and credit markets have recently experienced a period of extreme volatility and disruption that began in 2007. the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common 48 stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. these factors include:  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of publicly traded rics, bdcs or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  changes in law, regulatory policies or tax guidelines, or interpretations thereof, particularly with respect to rics or bdcs;  loss of our ric status;  changes in our earnings or variations in our operating results;  changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;  departure of ares capital management's key personnel;  operating performance of companies comparable to us;  short-selling pressure with respect to shares of our common stock or bdcs generally;  future sales of our securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock or the conversion of such securities, including the 2016 convertible notes;  general economic trends and other external factors; and  loss of a major funding source.         in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. if our stock price fluctuates significantly, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources from our business. our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan.         all dividends declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. as a result, our stockholders that opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock over time. our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of the 2016 convertible notes.         the 2016 convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning august 15, 2015 or, under certain circumstances, earlier. upon conversion, we have the choice to pay or deliver, as the case may be, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. the current conversion price of the 2016 convertible notes is approximately $19.13 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. if we elect to deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our tangible book value per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time, our stockholders may incur dilution. in addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2016 convertible notes and 49 any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance. our stockholders may receive shares of our common stock as dividends, which could result in adverse tax consequences to them.         in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to rics, we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. as long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion can be as low as 10% for our taxable years ending on or before december 31, 2011) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a result, a stockholder would be taxed on 100% of the dividend in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though most of the dividend was paid in shares of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.         sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale (including as a result of the conversion of our 2016 convertible notes into common stock), could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. if this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. item 1b.    unresolved
