item 1a. risk factors. the risk factors described below are not inclusive of all risk factors but highlight those that the company believes are the most significant and that could impact its performance and financial results. these risk factors should be considered together with all other information presented in this annual report. risks relating to our business our business depends on the appeal of our programming to our distributors and our viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile. our business depends in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. these factors are often unpredictable and volatile, and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment activities. we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets. a change in viewer preferences could cause our programming to decline in popularity, which could cause a reduction in advertising revenues and jeopardize renewal of our contracts with distributors. in addition, our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements, as well as greater amounts of available content, distribution and capital resources, and may be able to react more quickly than we can to shifts in tastes and interests. to an increasing extent, the success of our business depends on original programming, and our ability to predict accurately how audiences will respond to our original programming is particularly important. because original programming often involves a greater degree of commitment on our part, as compared to acquired programming that we license from third parties, and because our network branding strategies depend significantly on a relatively small number of original programs, a failure to anticipate viewer preferences for such programs could be especially detrimental to our business. we periodically review the programming usefulness of our program rights based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition. we have incurred write-offs of programming rights in the past, and may incur future programming rights write-offs if it is determined that program rights have no future usefulness. in addition, feature films constitute a significant portion of the programming on our amc, ifc and sundance channel programming networks. in general, the popularity of feature-film content on linear television is declining, due in part to the broad availability of such content through an increasing number of distribution platforms. should the popularity of feature-film programming suffer significant further declines, we may lose viewership or be forced to rely more heavily on original programming, which could increase our costs. if our programming does not gain the level of audience acceptance we expect, or if we are unable to maintain the popularity of our programming, our ratings may suffer, which will negatively affect advertising revenues, and we may have a diminished bargaining position when dealing with distributors, which could reduce our affiliation fee revenues. we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the success of any of our current programming, or generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming. if economic instability persists in the u.s. or in other parts of the world, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions. we derive substantial revenues from advertising spending by u.s. businesses, and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the u.s. could adversely affect advertising rates and volume, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues. decreases in u.s. consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions, in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are   17 table of contents carried. this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video distributors, which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues. similarly, a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks, which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers. furthermore, world-wide financial instability may affect our ability to penetrate new markets. because our networks are highly distributed in the u.s., our ability to expand the scope of our operations internationally is important to the continued growth of our business. our inability to negotiate favorable affiliation agreements with foreign distributors or to secure advertisers for those markets could negatively affect our results of operations. because a limited number of distributors account for a large portion of our business, the loss of any significant distributor would adversely affect our revenues. our programming networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of cable television system operators and other multichannel video programming distributors. in 2011, comcast and directv each accounted for at least 10% of our consolidated revenues, net. the loss of any significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. in addition, we have in some instances made upfront payments to distributors in exchange for additional subscribers or have agreed to waive or accept lower affiliation fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided. we also may help fund our distributors efforts to market our programming networks or we may permit distributors to offer promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. as we continue our efforts to add viewing subscribers, our net revenues may be negatively affected by these deferred carriage fee arrangements, discounted subscriber fees or other payments. if we are unable to renew our programming networks affiliation agreements, which expire at various dates through 2018, our revenues will be negatively affected. our programming networks have affiliation agreements that will expire at various dates through 2018. approximately 41% of our subscribers are under affiliation agreements that expire prior to december 31, 2013. failure to renew these affiliation agreements, or renewal on less favorable terms, or the termination of those agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business. a reduced distribution of our programming networks would adversely affect our affiliation fee revenue, and impact our ability to sell advertising or the rates we charge for such advertising. even if affiliation agreements are renewed, we cannot assure you that the renewal rates will equal or exceed the rates that we currently charge these distributors. furthermore, the largest multichannel video programming distributors have significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks. the two largest cable distributors provide service to approximately 35 percent of u.s. households receiving multichannel video programming distribution service, while the two largest dbs distributors provide service to an additional 33 percent of such households. further consolidation among multichannel video distributors could increase this leverage. in some cases, if a distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring distributor will govern following the acquisition. in those circumstances, the acquisition of a distributor that is party to one or more affiliation agreements with our programming networks on terms that are more favorable to us could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to intense competition, which may have a negative effect on our profitability or on our ability to expand our business. the cable programming industry is highly competitive. our programming networks compete with other programming networks and other types of video programming services for marketing and distribution by cable   18 table of contents and other multichannel video programming distribution systems. in distributing a programming network, we face competition with other providers of programming networks for the right to be carried by a particular cable or other multichannel video programming distribution system and for the right to be carried by such system on a particular tier of service. certain programming networks affiliated with broadcast networks like nbc, abc, cbs or fox may have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the bundling of carriage agreements for such programming networks with a distributors right to carry the affiliated broadcasting network. in addition, our ability to compete with certain programming networks for distribution may be hampered because the cable television or other multichannel video programming distributors through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with these programming networks. because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming networks to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased affiliation and advertising revenue for such programming networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. even if the affiliated distributors carry our programming networks, they may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving their affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own. as a result of the distribution, the company is no longer owned by cablevision, which may impact the competitive landscape in which we operate because some of our distributors have other commercial relationships with cablevision. because of these other relationships, the company has from time to time in the past achieved greater distribution or more favorable terms than it might have achieved as a stand-alone company. as a result, the companys ability to pursue cross-company initiatives that might provide such benefits are limited, since as separate public companies, we and cablevision are required to assess any such initiatives from our own business perspective. in addition to competition for distribution, we also face intense competition for viewing audiences with other cable and broadcast programming networks, home video products and internet-based video content providers, some of which are part of large diversified entertainment or media companies that have substantially greater resources than us. to the extent that our viewing audiences are eroded by competition with these other sources of programming content, our ratings would decline, negatively affecting advertising revenues, and we may face difficulty renewing affiliation agreements with distributors on acceptable terms, which could cause affiliation fee revenues to decline. in addition, competition for advertisers with these content providers, as well as with other forms of media (including print media, internet websites and radio), could affect the amount we are able to charge for advertising time on our programming networks, and therefore our advertising revenues. an important part of our strategy involves exploiting identified markets of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size. our programming networks have faced and will continue to face increasing competition obtaining distribution and attracting advertisers as other programming networks seek to serve the same or similar markets. our programming networks success depends upon the availability of programming that is adequate in quantity and quality, and we may be unable to secure or maintain such programming. our programming networks success depends upon the availability of quality programming, particularly original programming and films, that is suitable for our target markets. while we produce some of our original programming, we obtain most of the programming on our networks (including original programming, films and other acquired programming) through agreements with third parties that have produced or control the rights to such programming. these agreements expire at varying times and may be terminated by the other party if we are not in compliance with their terms. we compete with other programming networks to secure desired programming. competition for programming has increased as the number of programming networks has increased. other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may   19 table of contents have a competitive advantage over us in this area. in addition to other cable programming networks, we also compete for programming with national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, video-on-demand services and internet-based content delivery services, such as netflix, itunes and hulu. some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries. we cannot assure you that we will ultimately be successful in negotiating renewals of our programming rights agreements or in negotiating adequate substitute agreements in the event that these agreements expire or are terminated. our programming networks have entered into long-term programming acquisition contracts that require substantial payments over long periods of time, even if we do not use such programming to generate revenues. our programming networks have entered into numerous contracts relating to the acquisition of programming, including rights agreements with film companies. these contracts typically require substantial payments over extended periods of time. we must make the required payments under these contracts even if we do not use the programming. increased programming costs may adversely affect our profits. we incur costs for the creative talent, including actors, writers and producers, who create our original programming. some of our original programming has achieved significant popularity and critical acclaim, which has increased and could continue to increase the costs of such programming in the future. an increase in the costs of programming may lead to decreased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may not be able to adapt to new content distribution platforms and to changes in consumer behavior resulting from these new technologies, which may adversely affect our business. we must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies will affect our ability to maintain or grow our business. additionally, we must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by advances such as digital video recorders (or dvrs), video-on-demand, internet-based content delivery and mobile devices. such changes may impact the revenues we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods, either by decreasing the viewership of our programming networks on cable and other multichannel video programming distribution systems or by making advertising on our programming networks less valuable to advertisers. if we fail to adapt our distribution methods and content to emerging technologies, our appeal to our targeted audiences might decline and there could be a negative effect on our business. we face risks from doing business internationally. we distribute our programming outside the u.s. as a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. these risks include:        laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;        changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content;        differing degrees of protection for intellectual property;        the instability of foreign economies and governments;        fluctuating foreign exchange rates;   20 table of contents      war and acts of terrorism;        anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;        foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws;        varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property; and        shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-u.s. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. our business is limited by regulatory constraints, both domestic and foreign, which may adversely impact our operations. although most aspects of our business generally are not directly regulated by the fcc, under the communications act of 1934, there are certain fcc regulations that govern our business either directly or indirectly. see businessregulation. furthermore, to the extent that regulations and laws, either presently in force or proposed, hinder or stimulate the growth of the cable television and satellite industries, our business will be affected. the u.s. congress and the fcc currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations. the regulation of cable television services, satellite carriers, and other multichannel video programming distributors is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past two decades. further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated. we cannot assure you that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. an important aspect of our growth strategy involves the expansion of our programming networks and brands into markets outside the u.s. the distribution of our programming networks in foreign markets is subject to laws and regulations specific to those countries. changes in laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our business and ability to access new foreign markets. theft of our content, including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content, may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability. the success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights to our entertainment content. we are fundamentally a content company and theft of our brands, television programming, digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly affect us and the value of our content. copyright theft is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective copyright and technical protective measures similar to those existing in the u.s. or that lack effective enforcement of such measures. the interpretation of copyright, privacy and other laws as applied to our content, and piracy detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux. the failure to strengthen or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and negatively affect its value. content theft has been made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine security features such as encryption and the ability of pirates to cloak their   21 table of contents identities online. in addition, we and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content, a disruption of our services, or improper disclosure of confidential information. the increasing use of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of television shows, which is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the value of the affected programming. copyright theft has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such works. efforts to prevent the unauthorized distribution, performance and copying of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information in digital form necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information regarding our distributors, advertisers, viewers and employees as well as personal information. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. further, a penetration of our network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer or employee information could subject us to business, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if our technology facility fails or its operations are disrupted, our performance could be hindered. our programming is transmitted by our subsidiary, amc networks broadcasting & technology. amc networks broadcasting & technology uses its technology facility for a variety of purposes, including signal processing, program editing, promotions, creation of programming segments to fill short gaps between featured programs, quality control, and live and recorded playback. like other facilities, this facility is subject to interruption from fire, lightning, adverse weather conditions and other natural causes. equipment failure, employee misconduct or outside interference could also disrupt the facilitys services. although we have an arrangement with a third party to re-broadcast the previous 48 hours of our networks programming in the event of a disruption, we currently do not have a backup operations facility for our programming. in addition, we rely on third-party satellites in order to transmit our programming signals to our distributors. as with all satellites, there is a risk that the satellites we use will be damaged as a result of natural or man-made causes, or will otherwise fail to operate properly. although we maintain in-orbit protection providing us with back-up satellite transmission facilities should our primary satellites fail, there can be no assurance that such back-up transmission facilities will be effective or will not themselves fail.   22 table of contents any significant interruption at amc networks broadcasting & technologys facility affecting the distribution of our programming, or any failure in satellite transmission of our programming signals, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. the loss of any of our key personnel and artistic talent could adversely affect our business. we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of our senior executives. we generally do not maintain key man insurance. in addition, we depend on the availability of a number of writers, directors, producers, artistic talent and others, who are employees of third-party production companies that create our original programming. the loss of any significant personnel or artistic talent, or our artistic talent losing their current audience base, could have an adverse effect on our business. general risks our substantial debt and high leverage could adversely affect our business. we have a significant amount of debt. as of december 31, 2011, we have $2,291 million of total debt, excluding capital leases, $1,605 million of which is senior secured debt under our new senior secured credit facilities and $686 million of which is senior unsecured debt. our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences. for example, it could:        increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;        require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future programming investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;        limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;        place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors; and        limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. in the long-term, we do not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay at maturity our outstanding debt obligations. as a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets. failure to raise significant amounts of funding to repay these obligations at maturity could adversely affect our business. if we are unable to raise such amounts, we would need to take other actions including selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing other discretionary uses of cash. a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. if market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow. while we have entered into hedging agreements for a portion of our variable rate debt limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, such agreements do not offer complete protection from this risk. the agreements governing our debt, including our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business. the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:        borrow money or guarantee debt;   23 table of contents      create liens;        pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;        make specified types of investments;        enter into transactions with affiliates; and        sell assets or merge with other companies. our senior secured credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial ratios and tests, including, but not limited to a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests and ratios. failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. in addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. a significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale. at december 31, 2011, our consolidated financial statements included approximately $2.2 billion of consolidated total assets, of which approximately $389 million were classified as intangible assets. intangible assets primarily include affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships, advertiser relationships, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. while we believe that the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, you should not assume that we would receive any cash from the voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if we were not continuing as an operating business. we may have a significant indemnity obligation to cablevision if the distribution is treated as a taxable transaction. prior to the distribution, cablevision received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) to the effect that, among other things, the distribution, and certain related transactions would qualify for tax-free treatment under the internal revenue code to cablevision, the company, and holders of cablevision common stock. although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs, if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request were untrue or incomplete in any material respect, cablevision would not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under the code. rather, the ruling was based upon representations by cablevision that these conditions were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling. if the distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, cablevision would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. cablevisions stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of cablevisions earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each stockholders tax basis in his or her cablevision stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to the remaining value. it is expected that the amount of any such taxes to cablevisions stockholders and cablevision would be substantial.   24 table of contents as part of the distribution, we entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement with cablevision, which sets out each partys rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and refunds, if any, of federal, state, local or foreign taxes for periods before and after the distribution and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of irs and other audits. pursuant to the tax disaffiliation agreement, we are required to indemnify cablevision for losses and taxes of cablevision resulting from the breach of certain covenants and for certain taxable gain recognized by cablevision, including as a result of certain acquisitions of our stock or assets. if we are required to indemnify cablevision under the circumstances set forth in the tax disaffiliation agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could have a material negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. the tax rules applicable to the distribution may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the distribution. to preserve the tax-free treatment of the distribution to cablevision and its stockholders, under the tax disaffiliation agreement with cablevision, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are subject to restrictions with respect to:        entering into any transaction pursuant to which 50% or more of our equity securities or assets would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, unless certain tests are met;        issuing equity securities, if any such issuances would, in the aggregate, constitute 50% or more of the voting power or value of our capital stock;        certain repurchases of our common shares;        ceasing to actively conduct our business;        amendments to our organizational documents (i) affecting the relative voting rights of our stock or (ii) converting one class of our stock to another;        liquidating or partially liquidating; and        taking any other action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. furthermore, the tax disaffiliation agreement limits our ability to pre-pay, pay down, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire the senior unsecured notes or the term b facility portion of the amc networks debt. these restrictions may for a time limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that could increase the value of our business. these restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets. our historical financial results as a business segment of cablevision may not be representative of our results as a separate, stand-alone company. the historical financial information through june 30, 2011 included in this annual report has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of cablevision and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone company during those periods. although cablevision accounted for our company as a business segment, we were not operated as a separate, stand-alone company for the historical periods through june 30, 2011. the historical costs and expenses through june 30, 2011 reflected in our consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by cablevision, including general corporate expenses and employee benefits and incentives. these allocations were based on what we and cablevision considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in   25 table of contents support of our business. prior to its termination on june 30, 2011, our historical costs have also included a management fee paid to cablevision calculated based on certain of our subsidiaries gross revenues (as defined under the terms of the consulting agreement) on a monthly basis. the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we do not, effectively, establish our own financial, administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a separate, stand-alone company, and we cannot assure you that the transition services cablevision has agreed to provide us will be sufficient for our needs. historically, we have relied on financial, administrative and other resources of cablevision to support the operation of our business. as a result of our separation from cablevision, we have expanded our financial, administrative and other support systems and contracted with third parties to replace certain of cablevisions systems. we also have established our own credit and banking relationships and are performing our own financial and operational functions. any failure or significant downtime in our own financial or administrative systems or in cablevisions financial or administrative systems during the transition period could impact our results or prevent us from performing other administrative services and financial reporting on a timely basis and could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. in connection with the distribution, we rely on cablevisions performance under various agreements. in connection with the distribution, we entered into various agreements with cablevision, including a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, a transition services agreement, an employee matters agreement and certain other related party agreements and arrangements. these agreements govern our relationship with cablevision subsequent to the distribution and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the distribution. these agreements also include arrangements with respect to transition services and a number of on-going commercial relationships. the distribution agreement includes an agreement that we and cablevision agree to provide each other with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the businesses that were transferred to us by cablevision. we are also party to other arrangements with cablevision. we and cablevision rely on each other to perform each entitys obligations under these agreements. if cablevision were to breach or to be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, we could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses. if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the u.s. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. to comply with this statute, we will be required in 2012 to document and test our internal control procedures, and our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on the effective operation of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2012. the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. during the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. if our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.   26 table of contents we are controlled by the dolan family, which may create certain conflicts of interest and which means certain stockholder decisions can be taken without the consent of the majority of the holders of our class a common stock. we have two classes of common stock:        class b common stock, which is generally entitled to ten votes per share and is entitled collectively to elect 75% of our board of directors, and        class a common stock, which is entitled to one vote per share and is entitled collectively to elect the remaining 25% of our board of directors. as of december 31, 2011, the dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the dolan family, collectively beneficially own all of our class b common stock, less than 2% of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 70% of the total voting power of all our outstanding common stock. of this amount, cablevisions chairman, charles f. dolan, our executive chairman, and his spouse beneficially owned approximately 57.7% of our outstanding class b common stock, less than 1% of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 41% of the total voting power of all our outstanding common stock. the members of the dolan family holding class b common stock have executed a stockholders agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the voting power of the holders of our class b common stock will be cast as a block with respect to all matters to be voted on by holders of class b common stock. the dolan family is able to prevent a change in control of our company and no person interested in acquiring us will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the dolan family. charles f. dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities, by virtue of their stock ownership, have the power to elect all of our directors subject to election by holders of class b common stock and are able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of all classes of our common stock vote together as a single class. these matters could include the amendment of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the approval of fundamental corporate transactions. in addition, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the class b common stock, voting separately as a class, is required to approve:        the authorization or issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock, and        any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the class b common stock. as a result, charles f. dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities also collectively have the power to prevent such issuance or amendment. we have adopted a written policy whereby an independent committee of our board of directors will review and approve or take such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to certain transactions involving the company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and certain related parties, including charles f. dolan and certain of his family members and related entities on the other hand. this policy does not address all possible conflicts which may arise, and there can be no assurance that this policy will be effective in dealing with conflict scenarios. the members of the dolan family group have entered into an agreement with the company in which they agreed that during the 12-month period beginning on the distribution date, the dolan family group must obtain the prior approval of a majority of the companys independent directors prior to acquiring common stock of the company through a tender offer that results in members of the dolan family group owning more than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of the company. for purposes of this agreement, the term   27 table of contents independent directors means the directors of the company who have been determined by our board of directors to be independent directors for purposes of nasdaq corporate governance standards. we are a controlled company for nasdaq purposes, which allows us not to comply with certain of the corporate governance rules of nasdaq. charles f. dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities have entered into a stockholders agreement relating, among other things, to the voting of their shares of our class b common stock. as a result, we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of nasdaq. as a controlled company, we have the right to elect not to comply with the corporate governance rules of nasdaq requiring: (i) a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, (ii) an independent compensation committee and (iii) an independent corporate governance and nominating committee. our board of directors has elected for the company to be treated as a controlled company under nasdaq corporate governance rules and not to comply with the nasdaq requirement for a majority independent board of directors and an independent corporate governance and nominating committee because of our status as a controlled company. future stock sales, including as a result of the exercising of registration rights by certain of our shareholders, could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock. certain parties have registration rights covering a portion of our shares. we have entered into registration rights agreements with charles f. dolan, members of his family, certain dolan family interests and the dolan family foundations that provide them with demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to approximately 15.9 million shares of class a common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of shares of class b common stock. sales of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock could adversely affect the market price of the class a common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities. we share a senior executive and certain directors with cablevision and the madison square garden company, which may give rise to conflicts. our executive chairman, charles f. dolan, also serves as the chairman of cablevision. as a result, a senior executive officer of the company will not be devoting his full time and attention to the companys affairs. in addition, eight members of our board of directors are also directors of cablevision and seven members of our board are also directors of the madison square garden company (msg), an affiliate of cablevision and the company. these directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. for example, the potential for a conflict of interest exists when we on one hand, and cablevision or msg on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for us and either or both of them. also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between cablevision or msg and us. in addition, certain of our directors and officers, including charles f. dolan, own cablevision or msg stock, restricted stock units and options to purchase, and stock appreciation rights in respect of, cablevision or msg stock, as well as cash performance awards with any payout based on cablevisions or msgs performance. these ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, cablevision or msg. see certain relationships and related party transactionscertain relationships and potential conflicts of interest in our registration statement on form 10 filed with the sec for a description of our related party transaction approval policy that we have adopted to help address such potential conflicts that may arise.   28 table of contents our overlapping directors and executive officer with cablevision and madison square garden may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to and other conflicts with cablevision or madison square garden and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may provide us no remedy in that circumstance. the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that directors and officers of the company may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of cablevision and its subsidiaries or msg and its subsidiaries and that the company may engage in material business transactions with such entities. the company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the company who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of cablevision and its subsidiaries or msg and its subsidiaries will be liable to the company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in our certificate of incorporation) to cablevision or any of its subsidiaries or msg or any of its subsidiaries instead of the company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the company. these provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, assignments and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the company and cablevision or any of its subsidiaries or msg or any of its subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide that the actions of the overlapping directors or officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective stockholders. see description of capital stockcertain corporate opportunities and conflicts in our registration statement on form 10
