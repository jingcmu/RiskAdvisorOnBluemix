item 1a. risk factors. the company cautions readers that its business activities involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by the company.  the most significant of those risks are: risk of reduced selling prices, shipments and profits associated with a highly competitive industry with excess capacity. an increase in global capacity and new or expanded production capacity in the united states in recent years has resulted in capacity in excess of demand globally, as well as in the company’s primary markets in north america. the competitive landscape reflects improving, but uncertain, domestic and global economies; an uneven recovery within certain sectors of the domestic and global economies; continued high costs for many raw materials and continued intense competition from both foreign and domestic steel competitors. these conditions directly impact the pricing for ak steel’s products. at this time it is impossible to determine whether the domestic and/or global economies or industry sectors of those economies that are key to ak steel’s sales will continue to improve and generate demand that will utilize more of the existing excess capacity in the steel industry. furthermore, it is unknown how competitors will react to these and other factors and how their actions could affect market dynamics and ak steel’s sales of and prices for its products. thus, there is a risk of continued adverse effects on demand for ak steel’s products, the prices for those products, and ak steel’s sales and shipments of those products, which could negatively affect ak steel’s business, financial results and cash flows. risk of changes in the cost of raw materials and energy.  the price that ak steel pays for energy and key raw materials, such as electricity, natural gas, industrial gases, iron ore, coal and scrap, can fluctuate significantly based on market factors. the prices at which ak steel sells steel will not necessarily change in tandem with changes in its raw material and energy costs. a portion of ak steel’s shipments are in the spot market, and pricing for these products fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions.  the remainder of ak steel’s shipments are pursuant to contracts typically having durations of one year or less.  a portion of those contracts contain fixed prices that do not allow ak steel to pass through changes in the event of increases or decreases in raw material and energy costs. however, a significant majority of ak steel’s shipments to contract customers are pursuant to contracts with variable-pricing mechanisms that allow ak steel to adjust the price or to impose a surcharge based upon changes in certain raw material and energy costs. those adjustments, however, do not always reflect all of ak steel’s underlying raw material and energy cost changes. the scope of the adjustment may be limited by the terms of the negotiated language or by the timing of when the adjustment is effective relative to a cost increase. for shipments made to the spot market, market conditions or timing of sales may not allow ak steel to recover the full amount of an increase in raw material or energy costs. as a result of the factors set forth above with respect to spot market sales and contract sales, ak steel is not always able to recover through the price of its steel the full amount of cost increases associated with its purchase of energy or key raw materials. in such circumstances a significant increase in raw material or energy costs likely would adversely impact ak steel’s financial results and cash flows. conversely, in certain circumstances, ak steel’s financial results and cash flows also can be adversely affected when raw material prices decline. this can occur when the company locks in the price of a raw material over a period of time and the spot market price for the material declines during that period. because there often is a correlation between the price of finished steel and the raw materials of which it is comprised, a decline in raw material prices may coincide with lower steel prices, compressing the company’s margins. the impact of a change in raw materials prices also may be delayed by the need to consume existing inventories. new inventory may not be purchased until some portion of the existing inventory purchased earlier is consumed. the impact of this risk is particularly significant with respect to iron ore and scrap because of the volume used by operations and the associated costs. the exposure of the company to the risk of price increases with respect to iron ore and coal has been reduced by virtue of its recent investments in an iron ore joint venture and in the acquisition of coal reserves. these investments are expected over time to enable the company to acquire approximately one half of its annual iron ore and coal needs at prices that are less exposed to market fluctuations and are below current market prices, but there is a risk that the volume of iron ore and coal acquired by the company through these investments will be less than that in the event of delays in development or otherwise, or that the cost of raw materials from these operations will be higher than expected or above market prices. to the extent that the company must acquire its iron ore and coal at market prices, these prices are sensitive to global demand and thus have been volatile in recent years. future cost increases could be significant again with respect to iron ore and coal, as well as certain other raw materials, such as scrap. the impact of significant fluctuations in the price ak steel pays for its raw materials can be exacerbated by ak steel’s “last in, first out” (“lifo”) method for valuing inventories when there are changes in the cost of raw materials or energy or in ak steel’s raw material inventory levels as well as ak steel’s finished and semi-finished inventory levels. the impact of lifo accounting may be particularly significant with respect to period-to-period comparisons. - 5- table of contents                                                             risk related to the company’s significant amount of debt and other obligations.  as of december 31, 2013, ak steel had outstanding $1,540.1 of indebtedness (excluding unamortized discount) and additional obligations, as well as pension and other postretirement benefit obligations totaling $1,051.3. the company currently expects to contribute approximately $205.0 to its pension plans in 2014, as well as approximately $105.0 and $65.0 to its pension plans in 2015 and 2016, respectively. the company also from time to time has additional contractual commitments, including the commitment to contribute $100.0 to magnetation in 2014 prior to the commencement of its pellet plant’s operations. ak steel has the ability to borrow additional amounts under its credit facility. at december 31, 2013, ak steel had outstanding borrowings of $90.0 and outstanding letters of credit of $67.1 under its credit facility, resulting in remaining availability of $815.0 under its credit facility (subject to customary borrowing conditions, including a borrowing base). the amount of ak steel’s indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could increase ak steel’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require a substantial portion of the company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments, reducing the amount of cash flows available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or general corporate purposes; limit ak steel’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future to be used for such other purposes; reduce ak steel’s planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in the company’s business and the industry; and place ak steel at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing. risk of severe financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of the company’s major customers.  sales and operations of a majority of the company’s customers are sensitive to general economic conditions, especially as they affect the north american automotive and housing industries.  in the event of a significant weakening of current economic conditions, whether as a result of secular or cyclical issues, it could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by customers of ak steel. the concentration of customers in a specific industry, such as the automotive industry, may increase the risk to ak steel because of the likelihood that circumstances may affect multiple customers at the same time. ak steel could be adversely impacted by such financial hardships or bankruptcies. the nature of that impact would likely include lost sales or losses associated with the potential inability to collect all outstanding accounts receivables. such an event could negatively impact ak steel’s financial results and cash flows. risk of reduced demand in key product markets due to competition from alternatives to steel or other factors.  the automotive and housing markets are important elements of ak steel’s business. automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve increasing government-mandated fuel economy standards by 2025, and they are currently investigating alternatives to carbon steels, including aluminum. if demand from one or more of ak steel’s major automotive customers were to significantly decline as a result of increased use of competing materials in substitution for steel, reduced consumer demand, or other causes, it likely would negatively affect ak steel’s sales, financial results and cash flows. similarly, if demand for ak steel’s products sold to the housing market were to be reduced significantly, it could negatively affect ak steel’s sales, financial results and cash flows. risk of increased global steel production and imports.  actions by ak steel’s domestic or foreign competitors to increase production in and/or exports to the united states could result in an increased supply of steel in the united states, which could result in lower prices and shipments of ak steel’s products. in fact, significant increases in production capacity in the united states by competitors of ak steel already have occurred in recent years as new carbon and stainless steelmaking and finishing facilities have begun production. in addition, foreign competitors, especially those in china, have substantially increased their production capacity in the last few years, and in some instances have seemingly targeted the u.s. market for imports of certain higher value products, including electrical steels. these and other factors have contributed to a high level of imports of foreign steel into the united states in recent years and create a risk of even greater levels of imports, depending upon foreign market and economic conditions, the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, and other variables beyond ak steel’s control. a significant further increase in domestic capacity or foreign imports could adversely affect ak steel’s sales, financial results and cash flows. risks of excess inventory of raw materials.  ak steel has certain raw material supply contracts, particularly with respect to iron ore and coke, which have terms providing for minimum annual purchases, subject to exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances. if ak steel’s need for a particular raw material is reduced for an extended period significantly below what was projected at the contract’s inception, or what was projected at the time an annual nomination was made under that contract, ak steel could be required to purchase quantities of raw materials, particularly iron ore and coke, which exceed its anticipated annual needs. if that circumstance was to occur, and if ak steel was not successful in reaching agreement with a particular raw material supplier to reduce the quantity of raw materials it purchases from that supplier, then ak steel would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a given year than it needs, negatively affecting its financial results and cash flows. the impact on financial results could be exacerbated by ak steel’s lifo method for valuing inventories, which could be affected by changes in ak steel’s raw material inventory levels, as well as ak steel’s finished and semi-finished inventory levels. the impact of lifo accounting may be particularly significant with respect to period-to-period comparisons. risk of supply chain disruptions or poor quality of raw materials.  the company’s sales, financial results and cash flows could be adversely affected by transportation, raw material or energy supply disruptions, or poor quality of raw materials, particularly scrap, coal, coke, iron ore, alloys and purchased carbon steel slabs. for example, extreme cold weather conditions in the united states and canada impact shipping on the great lakes and could disrupt the delivery of iron ore to the company and/or increase the company’s costs related to iron ore. such disruptions or quality issues, whether the result of severe financial hardships or bankruptcies of suppliers, natural or - 6- table of contents                                                             man-made disasters or other adverse weather events, or other unforeseen circumstances or events, could reduce production or increase costs at one or more of ak steel’s plants and potentially adversely affect customers or markets to which ak steel sells its products. any such significant disruption or quality issue would adversely affect ak steel’s sales, financial results and cash flows. risk of production disruption or reduced production levels.  when business conditions permit, ak steel operates its facilities at production levels at or near capacity. high levels of production are important to ak steel’s financial results because they enable ak steel to spread its fixed costs over a greater number of tons. production disruptions could be caused by the idling of facilities due to reduced demand, such as resulting from economic downturns, or from excess capacity. such production disruptions also could be caused by unanticipated plant outages or equipment failures, particularly under circumstances where ak steel lacks adequate redundant facilities, such as with respect to its middletown works hot mill. in addition, the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, or similar events or circumstances could significantly disrupt ak steel’s operations, negatively impact the operations of other companies or contractors ak steel depends upon in its operations, or adversely affect customers or markets to which ak steel sells its products. any such significant disruption or reduced level of production would adversely affect ak steel’s sales, financial results and cash flows. risks associated with the company’s healthcare obligations.  ak steel provides healthcare coverage to its active employees and to a significant portion of its retirees, as well as to certain members of their families. ak steel is self-insured with respect to substantially all of its healthcare coverage. while ak steel has substantially mitigated its exposure to rising healthcare costs through cost sharing, healthcare cost caps and the establishment of veba trusts, the cost of providing such healthcare coverage may be greater on a relative basis for ak steel than for other steel companies against which ak steel competes because such competitors either provide a lesser level of benefits, require that their participants pay more for the benefits they receive, or do not provide coverage to as broad a group of participants (e.g., they do not provide retiree healthcare benefits). in addition, existing or new federal healthcare legislation could adversely affect ak steel’s financial condition through increased costs in the future. risks associated with the company’s pension obligations.  ak steel’s pension trust is currently underfunded to meet its long-term obligations. the extent of underfunding is directly affected by changes in interest rates and asset returns in the securities markets. it also is affected by the rate and age of employee retirements, along with actual experience compared to actuarial projections. these items affect pension plan assets and the calculation of pension obligations and expenses. such changes could increase the cost to ak steel of those obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on ak steel’s results and its ability to meet those obligations. in addition, changes in the law, rules, or governmental regulations with respect to pension funding could also materially and adversely affect the cash flow of ak steel and its ability to meet its pension obligations. also, under the method of accounting used by ak steel with respect to its pension obligations, ak steel recognizes into its results of operations, as a “corridor” adjustment, any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed 10% of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets. these corridor adjustments are driven mainly by changes in assumptions and by events and circumstances beyond ak steel’s control, primarily changes in interest rates, performance of the financial markets, and mortality and retirement projections. a corridor adjustment, if required after a re-measurement of ak steel’s pension obligations, historically has been recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. in certain past years, corridor adjustments have had a significant negative impact on ak steel’s financial statements in the year in which a charge was recorded, although the immediate recognition of the charge in that year has the beneficial effect of reducing its impact on future years. the recognition of a corridor charge does not have any immediate impact on the company’s cash flows. risk of not reaching new labor agreements on a timely basis.  most of ak steel’s hourly employees are represented by various labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates between march 2014 and september 2017. two of those contracts are scheduled to expire in 2014. the labor contract with the united steelworkers, local 169, which represents approximately 280 hourly employees at the company’s mansfield works located in mansfield, ohio, expires on march 31, 2014. the labor agreement with the international associations of machinists and aerospace workers, local 1943, which represents approximately 1,650 hourly employees at the company’s middletown works located in middletown, ohio, expires on september 15, 2014.  the company intends to negotiate with these unions to reach new, competitive labor agreements in advance of the current expiration dates.  the company cannot predict at this time, however, when new, competitive labor agreements with the unions at the mansfield works and middletown works will be reached or what the impact of such agreements will be on the company’s operating costs, operating income and cash flow. there is the potential of a work stoppage at these locations in 2014 as their collective bargaining agreements expire if the company and the unions cannot reach a timely agreement in contract negotiations.  if there was to be a work stoppage, it could have a material impact on the company’s operations, financial results and cash flows. to the extent that the company has labor contracts with unions at other locations which expire after 2014, a similar risk applies. risks associated with major litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues and other contingencies.  the company has described several significant legal and environmental proceedings in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.  with respect to environmental issues, changes in application or scope of regulations applicable to ak steel could have significant adverse impacts, including requiring capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the regulations, increased difficulty in obtaining future permits, incurring costs for emission allowances, restriction of production, and higher prices for certain raw materials. one or more of these adverse developments could negatively impact the company’s operations, financial results and cash flows. with respect to litigation, arbitrations and other legal proceedings, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters and the company could - 7- table of contents                                                             in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits, arbitrations and claims that could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.  in addition, while the company maintains insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, it may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future and, to the extent it obtains such insurance, it may not provide adequate coverage against all claims. the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to claims asserted against it in connection with litigation, arbitrations and environmental issues.  adverse developments in litigation, arbitrations or other legal proceedings may affect the company’s assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of its reserves, which could negatively affect its operations, financial results and cash flows. risk associated with regulatory compliance and changes.  ak steel’s business and the businesses of its customers and suppliers are subject to a wide variety of government oversight and regulation. the regulations promulgated or adopted by various government agencies, and the interpretations and application of such regulations, are dynamic and constantly evolving. to the extent new regulations arise, the application of existing regulations expands, or the interpretation of applicable regulations changes, ak steel may incur additional costs for compliance, including capital expenditures. ak steel may also be indirectly affected through regulatory changes impacting its customers or suppliers. such changes could reduce the competitiveness or even the viability of ak steel products to ak steel customers or cause ak steel suppliers to pass their increased costs of compliance through to ak steel in the form of higher prices for their goods or services. risks associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emission limitations. the united states has not ratified the 1997 kyoto protocol treaty (the “kyoto protocol”) and ak steel does not produce steel in a country that has ratified that treaty. negotiations for a treaty that would succeed the kyoto protocol are ongoing and it is not known yet what the terms of that successor treaty ultimately will be or if the united states will ratify it. it is possible, however, that limitations on greenhouse gas emissions may be imposed in the united states at some point in the future through federally-enacted legislation or regulation. the epa has issued and/or proposed regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions, including regulations that will require reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from large sources and suppliers in the united states. legislation previously has been introduced in the united states congress aimed at limiting carbon emissions from companies that conduct business that is carbon-intensive. among other potential material items, such bills could include a system of carbon emission credits issued to certain companies, similar to the european union’s existing “cap and trade” system. it is impossible at this time, however, to forecast what the final regulations and legislation, if any, will look like and the resulting effects on ak steel. depending upon the terms of any such regulations or legislation, however, ak steel could suffer negative financial impacts as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs in order to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. in addition, depending upon whether similar limitations are imposed globally, the regulations and/or legislation could negatively impact ak steel’s ability to compete with foreign steel companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. unless and until all of the terms of such regulation and legislation are known, however, ak steel cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on its financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. risks associated with financial, credit, capital and banking markets.  in the ordinary course of business, ak steel seeks to access competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets. currently, ak steel believes it has adequate access to these markets to meet its reasonably anticipated business needs. ak steel both provides and receives normal trade financing to and from its customers and suppliers. to the extent, if at all, access to competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets by ak steel, or its customers or suppliers, was to be impaired, ak steel’s operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. risk associated with the company’s use of derivative contracts to hedge commodity pricing volatility. the company uses cash-settled commodity price swaps and options to hedge the market risk for a portion of its raw material and energy purchases and the market risk associated with the sale of certain of its commodity steel products (hot roll carbon steel coils) to mitigate the risk of pricing volatility. for example, in the event the price of an underlying commodity falls below the price at which the company has hedged such commodity, the company will benefit from the lower market price for the commodity purchased, but will not realize the full benefit of the lower commodity price because of the amount that it has hedged. in certain circumstances the company also could be required to provide collateral for its potential derivative liability or close its hedging transaction for the commodity. additionally, there may be a lag in timing (particularly with respect to iron ore) between a decline in the price of a commodity underlying a derivative contract, which could cause the company to make payments in the short-term to provide collateral or settle its relevant hedging transaction, and the period in which the company experiences the benefits of the lower cost input through its direct purchases of the commodity. each of these risks related to the company's hedging transactions could adversely affect the company's financial results and cash flows. risk associated with the value of the company’s net deferred tax assets.  u.s. internal revenue laws and regulations and similar state laws applicable to the company and the rates at which it is taxed have a significant effect on its financial results.  for instance, the company has recorded deferred tax assets, including loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, on its consolidated balance sheets to reflect the economic benefit of tax positions that become deductible in future tax periods at the tax rate that is expected when they will be taken.  changes in tax laws or rates can materially affect the future deductible amounts related to deferred tax assets.  for example, a reduction in the tax rate would decrease the amount of tax benefit to be realized in the future and result in a charge to the income statement, which has the effect of reducing the company’s income at the time the tax rate change is enacted. the company has established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. in determining the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, the accounting standards - 8- table of contents                                                             allow the company to consider the timing of future reversal of its taxable temporary differences and available tax strategies that, if implemented, would result in the realization of deferred tax assets. the use of a tax planning strategy involving lifo inventory accounting will result in changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in relation to the amount of lifo income or expense the company records and could materially affect reported financial results. for more detail concerning the company’s net deferred tax assets, see the discussion in the critical accounting estimates section in item 7 and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. thus, changes in certain tax laws, a reduction in tax rates or a reduction in the realizable value of the deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results and financial condition. risk of inability to fully realize benefits of long-term cost savings and margin enhancement initiatives. in recent years the company has undertaken several significant projects in an effort to lower its costs and enhance its margins. these include efforts to lower its costs and increase its control over certain key raw materials through a strategy of vertically integrating into approximately one half of its annual supply of such key raw materials. ak steel intends to implement this strategy with respect to iron ore through its investment in magnetation and with respect to coal through its ramp-up of ak coal’s mining operations. other strategic initiatives to lower ak steel’s costs include increasing the utilization, yield and productivity of its facilities, implementing strategic purchasing procurement improvements, controlling maintenance spending, producing lower cost metallic burdens and reducing transportation costs. the company also has identified several other areas for enhancing its profitability, including increasing its percentage of contract sales (and lowering spot market sales), producing and selling a higher-value mix of products and developing new products that can command higher prices from customers. to the extent that one or more of the company’s significant cost-savings or margin enhancement projects is unsuccessful, or that several projects are significantly less effective in achieving the level of combined cost-savings or margin enhancement than the company is anticipating, or that the company does not achieve such results as quickly as anticipated, the company’s financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. risk of lower quantities, quality or yield of estimated coal reserves of ak coal.  ak steel has based estimated reserve information of its wholly-owned subsidiary, ak coal, on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by third-party engineers and geologists, with involvement of and review by company employees. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating yields from, quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond ak coal’s control. estimates of economically-recoverable coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, such as geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations, historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas, the assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies, and assumptions concerning coal prices, operating costs, development costs and reclamation costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. as a result, actual coal tonnage recovered from ak coal’s properties and the related costs may vary materially from ak steel’s estimates. in addition, actual or alleged defects in title in or the boundaries of the property that ak coal owns or its loss of any material leasehold interests could limit or eliminate its ability to mine these properties, which may reduce the estimated reserves controlled by ak coal or result in significant unanticipated costs to obtain the property rights to mine such reserves. risk of increased governmental regulation of mining activities.  ak steel’s ability to realize fully the expected benefits from ak coal and magnetation could be materially adversely affected by increased governmental regulation of mining and related activities, including difficulties or delays in or their failure to receive, maintain or modify environmental permits required for their operations. with respect to ak coal, the coal mining industry is subject to numerous and extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability. with respect to magnetation, although the construction and operation of its iron ore concentrate plants require limited environmental permits, magnetation will be required to seek new and amended permits with respect to the additional iron ore concentrate capacity that it intends to build and operate that is necessary to feed its iron ore pellet plant. furthermore, when magnetation’s pellet plant commences operation, it will be subject to most, if not all, of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations previously mentioned in regards to ak coal. the costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these laws and regulations are significant and may increase the costs of ak coal’s mining activities and magnetation’s pellet plant operations and could delay, or even preclude, the commencement of magnetation’s proposed additional iron ore concentrate capacity and the opening of additional mines by ak coal beyond its currently operational north fork mine. risk of inability to hire or retain skilled labor and experienced manufacturing and mining managers.  modern steel-making and mining uses specialized techniques and advanced equipment and requires experienced managers and skilled laborers. the manufacturing and mining industries in the united states are in the midst of a shortage of experienced managers and skilled laborers. this shortage is due in large part to demographic changes, as such laborers and managers are retiring at a faster rate than replacements are entering the workforce or achieving a comparable level of experience. if ak steel or ak coal are unable to hire or contract sufficient experienced managers and skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on the productivity of these operations and the ultimate benefits to ak steel. risk of it security threats and sophisticated cybercrime.  the company relies upon it systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities. in addition, the company collects and stores sensitive data.  the company has taken, and intends to continue - 9- table of contents                                                             to take, what it believes are appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent security breaches in its systems and networks. in recent years, however, there appears to have been an increase in both the number and sophistication of it security threats and cybercrimes. these it security threats and increasingly sophisticated computer crimes, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of ak steel’s systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data.  a failure of or breach in security could expose the company to risks of production downtimes and operations disruptions, misuse of information or systems, or the compromising of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect the company’s reputation, competitive position, business and financial results. while the previously listed items represent the most significant risks to the company, the company regularly monitors and reports risks to management and the board of directors by means of a formal total enterprise risk management program. item 1b. unresolved
