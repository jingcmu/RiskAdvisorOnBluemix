undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. 1 part i item 1. business company overview we are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits (ics) used in virtually all types of electronic equipment. since our inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in electronic equipment. our signal processing products play a fundamental role in converting, conditioning, and processing real-world phenomena such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed and motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic devices. as new generations of digital applications evolve, new needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal processing (dsp) technology are generated. as a result, we produce a wide range of innovative products — including data converters, amplifiers and linear products, radio frequency (rf) ics, power management products, sensors based on micro-electro mechanical systems (mems) technology and other sensors, and processing products, including dsp and other processors — that are designed to meet the needs of a broad base of customers. we focus on key strategic markets where our signal processing technology is often a critical differentiator in our customers’ products, in particular, the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications markets. used by over 60,000 customers worldwide, our products are embedded inside many different types of electronic equipment including: • industrial process control systems   • medical imaging equipment • factory automation systems   • patient monitoring devices • instrumentation and measurement systems   • wireless infrastructure equipment • energy management systems   • networking equipment • aerospace and defense electronics   • optical systems • automobiles   • digital cameras • digital televisions   • portable electronic devices we were incorporated in massachusetts in 1965. our headquarters are near boston, in norwood, massachusetts. in addition, we have manufacturing facilities in massachusetts, ireland, and the philippines, and have more than thirty design facilities worldwide. our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol adi and is included in the standard & poor’s 500 index. available information we maintain a website with the address www.analog.com. we are

individual transistors, or ics, in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ics may be divided into two general categories, digital and analog. digital circuits, such as memory devices and microprocessors, generally process on-off electrical signals, represented by binary digits, “1” and “0”. in contrast, analog ics monitor, condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems. analog ics also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems. 2 organizational structure we operate in one reporting segment based on the aggregation of five operating segments. the organization of these operating segments is based upon the products manufactured and the end markets served. the product group is focused on core technology development and leadership in converters, amplifiers and rf, mems, power management, and dsp. the end market-focused organization is dedicated to understanding, selecting, and resourcing initiatives that are more customized to a particular market or application. the focus of this team is to apply the full expanse of our broad technology portfolio to more integrated and targeted product strategies for the industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications markets. the end market group includes our sales organization. these two groups collaborate at all levels. on one hand, our product group develops key technology for use by the end market groups, which apply these technologies to specific applications. equally important, the applications expertise within each end market group is used to enhance core technology development by our product group. principal products we design, manufacture and market a broad line of high-performance ics that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. our ics are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. our product portfolio includes both general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications, as well as application-specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. by using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. given the high cost of developing more customized ics, our standard products often provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. however, for some industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications products, we focus on working with leading customers to design application-specific solutions. we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion, amplification, rf, mems, power management and dsp, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. because we have already developed the core technology for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly. we produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reporting segment. our ten highest revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue for fiscal 2012. a breakdown of our fiscal 2012 revenue by product category follows.     percent of     fiscal 2012 product category   revenue* converters   44% amplifiers/ radio frequency   26% other analog   15% power management & reference   7% digital signal processing   9% _________ *   the sum of the individual percentages do not equal 100% due to rounding. analog products our analog and mixed signal ic technology has been the foundation of our business for over four decades, and we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of high-performance analog ics. our analog signal processing ics are primarily high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater bandwidth, and other enhanced features. the principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors’ products include higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in improved performance and reliability. our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. our analog ics typically have long product life cycles. our analog ic customers include original equipment manufacturers (oems) and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems. converters — we are a leading supplier of data converter products. data converters translate real-world analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals. data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products. our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications electronics. 3 amplifiers/radio frequency — we are also a leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers. amplifiers are used to condition analog signals. high performance amplifiers emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision. within this product portfolio we provide precision, instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/rf, broadband, and other amplifiers. we also offer an extensive portfolio of precision voltage references that are used in a wide variety of applications. our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high performance rf ics covering the entire rf signal chain, from industry-leading stand-alone rf function blocks such as phase locked loops, frequency synthesizers, mixers, modulators, demodulators, and power detectors, to highly integrated broadband and short-range single chip transceiver solutions. our high performance rf ics support the high performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and a broad range of applications in our target markets. other analog — also within our analog technology portfolio are products that are based on mems technology. this technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. our mems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation, inertial measurement units used to sense multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types along multiple axis, and mems microphones used to sense audio. the majority of our current revenue from mems products is derived from the automotive end market. the consumer and, to a lesser extent, the industrial end markets accounted for the balance of revenue from mems products in fiscal year 2012. in addition to our mems products, our other analog product category includes isolators that enable designers to implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power, performance, and reliability constraints found with optocouplers. our isolators have been designed into hundreds of applications, such as universal serial bus isolation in patient monitors, where it allows hospitals and physicians to adopt the latest advances in computer technology to supervise patient health and wirelessly transmit medical records. in smart metering applications, our isolators provide reliable electrostatic discharge performance that helps reduce meter tampering. likewise, in satellites, where any malfunction can be catastrophic, our isolators help protect the power system while enabling designers to achieve small form factors. power management & reference — power management & reference products make up the balance of our analog sales. those products which include functions such as power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy management, are developed to complement analog signal chain components across core market segments from micro power, energy-sensitive battery applications to efficient, high performance power systems in infrastructure and industrial applications. digital signal processing products digital signal processing products (dsps) complete our product portfolio. dsps are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital signal conversion. our dsps are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. programmable dsps are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software. our general-purpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers. our dsps are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products. we support these products with easy-to-use development tools, which are designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs and time-to-market. our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal processing challenges across our core market and segment focus areas within the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications end markets. as an integrated part of our customers' signal chain, there are typically many other analog devices products connected to our processors including converters, audio and video codecs and power management solutions. 4 markets and applications the breakdown of our fiscal 2012 revenue by end market is set out in the table below.     percent of     fiscal 2012 end market   revenue industrial   46% automotive   17% consumer   17% communications   20% the following describes some of the characteristics of, and customer products within, our major end markets: industrial — our industrial market includes the following sectors: industrial and instrumentation — our industrial automation applications generally require ics that offer performance greater than that available from commodity-level ics but generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom ics. there is a trend towards development of products focused on particular sub-applications, which incorporate combinations of analog, mixed-signal, and dsp ics to achieve the necessary functionality. our instrumentation customers differentiate themselves by using the highest performance analog and mixed-signal ics available. our industrial and instrumentation market includes applications such as: • process control systems   • oscilloscopes

application-specific products and are used in applications such as: • utility meters   • wind turbines • meter communication modules   • solar inverters • substation relays and automation equipment   • building energy automation/control healthcare — two significant trends in the healthcare market today are the increasing need for higher channel counts in medical imaging systems to improve resolution and throughput while achieving a lower cost per channel, and the movement of highly accurate patient monitoring devices from the hospital environment to the home, improving patient care and reducing overall healthcare costs. our innovative technologies are designed into a variety of high performance imaging, patient monitoring, medical instrumentation, and home health devices. our offerings include both standard and application-specific products and are used in applications such as: • ultrasound   • infusion pumps • ct scanners   • clinical lab instrumentation • digital x-ray   • surgical instrumentation • multi-parameter patient monitors   • blood analyzers • pulse oximeters   • activity monitors 5 automotive — we develop differentiated high performance signal processing solutions that enable sophisticated automotive systems addressing the three industry macrotrends namely greener, safer and more comfort. through collaboration with manufacturers worldwide, adi has achieved significant market share through a broad portfolio of analog, digital and mems ics that increase fuel efficiency, enhance vehicle stability and improve the audio/video experience of the passengers. specifically, we have developed products used in applications such as: green   safety   comfort •   hybrid electric / electric vehicles   •   crash sensors in airbag systems   •   car audio amplifiers •   intelligent battery sensors   •   electronic stability systems   •   head unit solutions •   battery monitoring and management systems   •   advanced driver assistance systems (radar/vision)   •   rear seat entertainment systems         •   vehicle dynamic control systems         consumer — market demand for digital entertainment systems and the consumer demand for high quality voice transmissions, music, movies and photographs with a high degree of interactivity have allowed us to combine analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that meet the rigorous cost and time-to-market requirements of the consumer electronics market. the emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer products has created a market for our high-performance ics with a high level of specific functionality. these products include: • digital cameras   • high-performance audio/video equipment • high-definition televisions and dvd recorders/players   • portable media devices (smart phones, tablets and cellular handsets) • home theater systems   • computers communications — the development of broadband, wireless and internet infrastructures around the world has created an important market for our communications products. communications technology involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data. the need for higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient communications, has been creating demand for our products. our products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for internet protocol, video streaming and voice communication. in wireless and broadband communication applications, our products are incorporated into: •   cellular basestation equipment   •   wired networking equipment •   wireless backhaul systems   •   satellite systems see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our products by category and end market. research and development our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes, and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes. we spent approximately $512 million during fiscal 2012 on the design, development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes, compared to approximately $506 million during fiscal 2011 and approximately $492 million during fiscal 2010. our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters, amplifiers and rf, mems, power management, and dsp. in support of our research and development activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world. patents and other intellectual property rights we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets. we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries. as of november 3, 2012, we held approximately 1,900 u.s. patents and approximately 700 non-provisional pending u.s. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2012 through 2031. there can be no 6 assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. while our patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions, if we determine other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components. sales channels we sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. we have direct sales offices, sales representatives and/or distributors in over 40 countries outside north america. we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. we publish and distribute product catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products. we also provide this information and sell products via our website. we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. in addition, we offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers. we derived approximately 55% of our fiscal 2012 revenue from sales made through distributors. these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. in all regions of the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. in addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. segment financial information and geographic information we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of five operating segments. through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states. during fiscal 2012, we derived approximately 70% of our revenue from customers in international markets. our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments. although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies. during fiscal year 2012, we revised our method for classifying revenue by geographic region to more accurately reflect the primary location of our customers' design activity for our products. in general, the prior classification method reflected the customers' manufacturing location or the distributors' stocking territory. no changes have been made to our revenue recognition policy. a breakdown of our fiscal 2012 revenue by geographic location follows.     percent of     fiscal 2012 geographic area    revenue united states   30% rest of north/south america   4% europe   32% japan   12% china   13% rest of asia   9% 7 for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry, segment and geographic areas, see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. customers we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2012, 2011, or 2010 revenue. these customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial, automotive, consumer and communication markets. our largest single customer, excluding distributors, represented approximately 3% of our fiscal 2012 revenue. our 20 largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately 33% of our fiscal 2012 revenue. seasonality sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season. in general, the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations. in addition, as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k, our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry. production and raw materials monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging. we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance analog, dsp, mixed-signal and mems ics. we also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or cmos, wafer fabrication processes. our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at third-party wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital cmos processes. we currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company (tsmc). we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington, massachusetts and limerick, ireland. we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products. capital spending was approximately $132 million in fiscal 2012, compared with approximately $123 million in fiscal 2011. we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately $90 million to $120 million in fiscal 2013.  our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers. we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products. however, a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, primarily tsmc. if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to our customers. although we have experienced shortages of components, materials and external foundry services from time to time, these items have generally been available to us as needed. backlog backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was approximately $357 million, down from approximately $379 million at the end of fiscal 2011. we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. in periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. as is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty. accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue. we typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. in some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and 8 have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. in other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand. as a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. further, those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. government contracts we estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2012 revenue was attributable to sales to the u.s. government and u.s. government contractors and subcontractors. our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm, fixed-price subcontracts. most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the u.s. government. acquisitions, divestitures and investments an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. from time to time, we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business. additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. competition we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors, including technological innovation, strength of brand, diversity of product portfolio, product performance, technical support, delivery capabilities, customer service quality, reliability and price, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets, and customers. we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive. our competitors include but are not limited to: • broadcom corporation   • maxim integrated products, inc. • cirrus logic, inc.    • microchip technology, inc. • freescale semiconductor, inc.    • nxp semiconductors • infineon technologies   • st microelectronics • intersil corporation   • silicon laboratories, inc. • knowles electronics   • texas instruments, inc. • linear technology corporation     we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support, enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets. environment, health and safety we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and the public. we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental, health and safety (ehs) regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities, and to encourage pollution prevention, reduce our water and energy consumption, reduce waste generation, and strive towards continual improvement. we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system. our management systems are certified to iso 14001, ohsas 18001, iso 9001 and ts16949. we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition, (eicc). our sustainability report, first published in 2009, states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards, among other things. we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in, or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. 9 our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal, state, local and foreign ehs laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the transportation, storage, handling, use, emission, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products, including the restriction of hazardous substances (rohs) directive in the european union and china and the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach) directive in the european union. contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards. compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. there can be no assurance, however, that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines, suspension of production, the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability. employees as of november 3, 2012, we employed approximately 9,200 individuals worldwide. our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes. we believe that relations with our employees are good; however, the competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 10 item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. there is significant uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets, exacerbated by the ongoing european debt crisis. these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. uncertainty regarding the future stability of the euro zone could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. during the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. if economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.       our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including: • the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products; • changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products; • our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration; • the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors; • competitive pricing pressures; • fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity; • the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components; • any significant decline in our backlog; • the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory; • our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers; • changes in geographic, product or customer mix; • our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels; • potential significant litigation-related costs; • the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials; • the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental and social responsibility regulations; • changes in our effective tax rates in the united states, ireland or worldwide; and • the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control. 11 in addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. as a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis. in addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline. changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations. a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162(m) of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits (credits) in our additional paid in capital (apic) pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock-based compensation awards are less than those originally anticipated; changes in available tax credits; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods. long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. we typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. in certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. in other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands. as a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. further, orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, improve our products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets. our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products. product development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. in addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. in addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. 12 we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside the united states. many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve. competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. we rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. we rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. this reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. we currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, or tsmc. in addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. in certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers. the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. in addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected. our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products. semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. we invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. our customers have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. in certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. if any of our 13 products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process. minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. we are involved in frequent litigation, including regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid. from time to time, we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. we primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties. our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. any such compromise of our information security could result in unauthorized access to our confidential business or proprietary information. there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. as such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our u.s. patents and applications. even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. 14 if we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected. our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. the competition for these employees is intense. the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. in addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. to remain competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products. an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. both in the u.s. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. in order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.        acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including: • difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses; • diversion of management attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets; • strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations; • the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant; • potential loss of key employees; • exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and • increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation. if we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. we rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products. we, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. for example, our fiscal 2011 revenue in japan declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country. in addition, recent flooding in thailand and the philippines had disruptive effects on local semiconductor-related businesses. any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 15 we are exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states, including in ireland and the philippines. approximately 70% of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets. although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies. potential interest rate increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. at november 3, 2012, our principal source of liquidity was $3,900.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,105.8 million was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility, through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic, political and legal risks inherent in international operations, including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies. other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections. we also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans. there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes. we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china. our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. in addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or u.s.-china relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors. a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected. we are subject to increasingly strict environmental, health and safety (ehs) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results. our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made. in addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. any failure to control such materials 16 adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages, penalties, and civil and criminal fines, and might damage our reputation, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our operating results. new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. in addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the u.s. congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. the epa is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. additionally, any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines, suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and damage to our reputation. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our two issuances of $375.0 million senior unsecured notes or our $145.0 million term loan facility. in fiscal 2009, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due july 1, 2014. in april 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due april 15, 2016. in december 2010, analog devices holdings b.v., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a $145.0 million term loan facility which matures on december 22, 2013. our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: • seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; • refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes; • divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations; • sell selected assets; or • reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures. such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes or our term loan facility, which could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms. restrictions in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities. our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our 5.0% and 3.0% senior unsecured notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. in addition, our credit and term loan facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. if we breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. 17 our stock price may be volatile. the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by the following factors: • crises in global credit, debt and financial markets; • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; • changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance; • changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation or capital commitments; • departures of key personnel; • alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and • negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors. the stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results. 18 item 1b. unresolved
