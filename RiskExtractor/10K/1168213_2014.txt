item 1a.  risk factors cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the exchange act . such forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our strategic direction, prospects and future results. certain factors, including factors outside of our control, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. the following risk factors should be read in connection with evaluating our business and future prospects. all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after such statements are made. such uncertainties include, among others, the following factors: if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to consumers' fashion preferences, domestically and/or internationally, in a timely manner, our profitability will decline. if we are not able to keep pace with the rapidly changing fashion trends, both domestically and/or internationally, and teen consumer apparel tastes, our profitability will decline, as it did in 2013. we produce casual, comfortable on trend apparel, much of which displays the “aéropostale”, “aéro” or “p.s. from aéropostale” logo and also fashion oriented apparel. there can be no assurance that fashion trends will not move away from casual clothing or that we will not have to alter our design strategy to reflect changes in consumer preferences. failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in styles, trends, desired images or brand preferences has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. industry conditions are increasingly competitive. the teen and child specialty retail industries have historically been highly competitive. one of our competitive advantages throughout our history has been our promotional business model. a number of our competitors are now also operating a more promotional business, similar to our own. as a result we now face increased competition based upon price and promotion which we have not experienced previously. greater or continued promotional activity in the teen or child specialty retail industries could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. the effect of global, national, regional and local economic pressures and conditions may adversely affect our sales. the global economic crisis continues to cause a great deal of uncertainty. this market uncertainty continues to result in reduced consumer confidence and spending.  our business is highly sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences. various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates (including the high level of teenage unemployment), interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. accordingly, consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products, may decline during recessionary periods and periods of economic uncertainty, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. in addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic, as a result of, among other things, higher gasoline prices, could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. therefore, our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions on a local, regional, national and/or global level. our customer continues to be adversely impacted by the current macroeconomic environment. in addition, we believe that a decline in mall traffic has adversely affected our results of operations.   our ability to react to raw material cost increases, labor and energy prices could reduce our overall profitability.    global inflationary economic conditions, as well as increases in our product costs, such as raw materials, labor and fuel, have reduced our overall profitability. specifically, increases in the price of cotton, used in the manufacture of merchandise we purchase from our suppliers, negatively impacts our cost of goods. in addition, any reduction in merchandise available to us or any significant increase in the costs to produce that merchandise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we have strategies in place to mitigate the rising cost of raw materials and our overall profitability depends on the success of those strategies. additionally, increases in other costs, including labor and energy, could adversely impact our results of operations as well. 11 table of contents a significant decrease in sales could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. our net sales are disproportionately higher from august through january each year due to increased sales from back-to-school and holiday shopping. our net sales from february through july are typically lower due to, in part, the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season. any significant decrease in sales during any season, but in particular the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. in addition, in order to prepare for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year. any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products would require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which would reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively impact our profitability. additionally, our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts which may occur during key selling times such as school holidays, easter and regional fluctuations in the calendar during the back-to-school selling season. our ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which we are located. in order to generate customer traffic, we must locate our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls. we cannot control the development of new shopping malls, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, or the success of individual shopping malls. a significant decrease in shopping mall traffic would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, the loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, or the closure of a significant number of shopping malls in which we have stores, either by a single landlord with a large portfolio of malls, or by a number of smaller individual landlords, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. fluctuations in comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations may cause the price of our common stock to decline substantially. our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including: • actions of our competitors or mall anchor tenants; • changes in general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns; • fashion trends; • changes in our merchandise mix; • the effectiveness of our inventory management; • calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods; • the timing of promotional events;  • weather conditions; and • the seasonality of our business reflecting the general peak sales for teen clothing and accessories during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. if our comparable store sales and/or results of operations fail to meet the expectations of investors then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially. you should refer to the section entitled “management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for more information. internet sales are subject to numerous risks. we sell merchandise over the internet through our e-commerce websites, www.aeropostale.com, www.ps4u.com and www.gojane.com. our internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including: 12 table of contents •the successful implementation of new systems and internet or mobile platforms; • the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, causing, among other things, website downtimes and other technical failures; •reliance on third-party computer hardware/software; •rapid technological change; •liability for online content; •violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online privacy; •credit card fraud; and •telecommunications failures and vulnerability to electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.    our failure to successfully address and respond to these risks could reduce internet sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brand. closing stores could result in significant costs to us. we have announced plans to close underperforming stores and could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect. if we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or “buy out” the remaining term of the lease. we also may incur costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early. upon any such closure, the closing costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand. failure of new business concepts would have a negative effect on our results of operations. we expect that the introduction of new brand concepts, such as the launch in fiscal 2009 of our store brand concept p.s. from aéropostale and the acquisition of gojane in fiscal 2012, as well as other new business opportunities, such as international expansion, will play an important role in our overall business strategy. our ability to succeed with a new brand concept requires significant expenditures and management attention. additionally, any new brand is subject to certain risks including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including management and designers, diversion of management's attention from our core aéropostale business and the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores. we rely on a small number of vendors to supply a significant amount of our merchandise. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we sourced approximately 83% of our merchandise from our top five merchandise vendors. our relationships with our suppliers generally are not on a long-term contractual basis and do not provide assurances on a long-term basis as to adequate supply, quality or acceptable pricing. most of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities and therefore we depend upon independent third party vendors to manufacture all of the merchandise we sell in our stores. if any of our vendors, especially our primary vendors which manufacture the majority of our merchandise, ship orders to us late, do not meet our quality standards, or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, then there would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our foreign sources of production may not always be reliable, which may result in a disruption in the flow of new merchandise to our stores. the large majority of the merchandise that we purchase is manufactured overseas. we generally do not have any long-term merchandise supply contracts with our vendors and the imports of our merchandise by our vendors are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs and quotas. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: (i) political instability; (ii) labor instability/employee unrest 13 table of contents (iii) enhanced security measures at foreign and united states ports, which could delay delivery of goods; (iv) imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a region within which we do business; (v) imposition of additional or greater duties, taxes, and other charges on imports; (vi) delayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of our vendors to comply with applicable import regulations; and (vii) delayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to unexpected or significant port congestion or labor unrest at united states ports. any disruption to our vendors and our foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above or due to other unforeseeable events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our business could suffer if a manufacturer fails to use acceptable labor practices. our sourcing agents and independent manufacturers are required to operate in compliance with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations. while our vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices for our vendors and suppliers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. the violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer, or by one of the sourcing agents, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or sourcing agent's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products or damage our reputation. any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. to help mitigate this risk, we engage a third party independent contractor to visit the production facilities from which we receive our products. this independent contractor assesses the compliance of the facility with, among other things, local and united states labor laws and regulations as well as foreign and domestic fair trade and business practices. the unexpected loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. our key executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in the retail industry and have made significant contributions to the growth and success of our brands. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect us. modifications and/or upgrades to our information technology systems may disrupt our operations. we regularly evaluate our information technology systems and requirements. modifications may include replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of the inherent risks associated with replacing, modifying, upgrading, maintaining and expanding these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, there is no assurance that a successfully implemented system will deliver the anticipated value to us. we could face liability from, or our ability to conduct business could be adversely affected by, government and private actions concerning personally identifiable data, including privacy. our direct marketing business is subject to federal and state laws regarding the collection, maintenance and disclosure of personally identifiable information we collect and maintain in our database. if we do not comply, we could become subject to liability. while these provisions do not currently unduly restrict our ability to operate our business, if those regulations become more restrictive, they could adversely affect our business. in addition, laws or regulations that could impair our ability to collect and use user names and other information on our e-commerce websites may adversely affect our business. for example, the children’s online privacy protection act of 1999, as amended, currently limits our ability to collect personal information from website visitors who may be under age 13. further, claims could also be based on other misuse of personal information, such as for unauthorized marketing purposes. if we violate any of these laws, we could face civil penalties. in addition, the attorneys general of various states review company websites and their privacy policies from time to time. in particular, an attorney general may examine such privacy policies to assure that the policies overtly and explicitly inform users of the manner in which the information they provide will be used and disclosed by the company. if one or more attorneys general were to determine that our privacy policies fail to conform to state law, we also could face fines or civil penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business. our failure to appropriately safeguard the personally identifiable information of customers, employees and third parties could subject us to reputational damage and/or legal liability. 14 table of contents information technology system disruption and cyber security risks could harm our net sales, increase our expenses, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business.      we depend on information technology systems for the successful operation of our business, including email communications, the design, manufacture and distribution of our products, marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, processing of credit card transactions, ecommerce activities and the use of social media to interact with our customers. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. we collect, retain and transmit confidential information over such systems. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our customers, employees, third parties and investors. we could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as well as increased costs such as organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees, engaging consultants. in addition, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber security breach. while to the best of our knowledge, we have not experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber security breach or other act, any cyber security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. we rely on third parties to manage our distribution centers and transport our merchandise to our stores; a disruption of our distribution activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute, in a timely manner, our merchandise to our store locations throughout the united states, canada and puerto rico. we currently lease and maintain two third-party independently operated distribution facilities, one in south river, new jersey, and the other in ontario, california. in addition, we also utilize a third distribution center, located in canada, which is independently owned and operated. these distribution centers manage, collectively, the receipt, storage, sortation, packaging and distribution of virtually all of our merchandise. these third parties employ personnel represented by labor unions. although there have been no work stoppages or disruptions since the inception of our relationships with these third party providers, there can be no assurance that work stoppages or disruptions will not occur in the future. we also use separate third party transportation companies to deliver our merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores. any failure by any of these third parties to respond adequately to our warehousing, distribution and transportation needs would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.  as a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the sec and the nyse. failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. we rely on a third party to manage the web-hosting, operation, warehousing and order fulfillment for our e-commerce business; any disruption of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce business. we rely on one third party, gsi commerce, inc. (“gsi”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ebay inc., to host our e-commerce website, warehouse all of the inventory sold through our e-commerce website, and fulfill all of our e-commerce sales to our customers. gsi also performs additional services for us supporting our e-commerce business. any significant interruption in the operations of gsi, over which we have no control, could have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce business. 15 table of contents failure to protect our trademarks adequately could negatively impact our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our key trademarks aéropostale®, aero® and 87® and p.s. from aéropostale™ and variations thereof, are integral to our logo-driven design strategy. in addition, the trademarks for our gojane business acquired in late 2012 are important to our business strategy. we have obtained federal registrations of or have pending applications for these trademarks in the united states and have applied for or obtained registrations in most foreign countries in which our vendors and licensees are located, as well as elsewhere. we use these trademarks in many constantly changing designs and logos even though we have not applied to register every variation or combination thereof for adult clothing and related accessories. there can be no assurance that the registrations we own and have obtained will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third party imitates our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected. there can be no assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture, export or sale of our products as a violation of their trademarks or other proprietary rights. other entities may have rights to trademarks that contain portions of our marks or may have registered similar or competing marks for apparel and accessories in foreign countries in which our vendors are located. there may also be other prior registrations in other foreign countries of which we are not aware. accordingly, it may not be possible, in those few foreign countries where we were not able to register our marks, to enjoin the manufacture, sale or exportation of aéropostale or p.s. from aéropostale or gojane branded goods to the united states. if we were unable to reach a licensing arrangement with these parties, our vendors may be unable to manufacture our products in those countries. our inability to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from or manufacture in less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan change to include selling our merchandise in those jurisdictions outside the united states. we have recorded store asset impairment charges in the past and we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to recognize an impairment charge when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. management’s policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists (i.e., a triggering event) comprises measurable operating performance criteria as well as qualitative measures. if a determination is made that the asset’s carrying value is not recoverable over its estimated useful life, the asset is written down to estimated fair value, if lower. the determination of fair value of the assets is generally based on estimated expected discounted future cash flows, which is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows identifiable with the long-lived asset at our weighted-average cost of capital. we have recognized impairment charges of approximately $46.1 million in fiscal 2013 for 230 stores, $32.6 million in fiscal 2012 for 119 stores and $16.0 million in fiscal 2011 for 39 stores related to underperforming store locations. additionally, pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to perform impairment tests on our identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually or at any time when certain events occur, which could impact the value and earnings of our operating segments. our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of the assets’ fair market values with the assets’ carrying values. significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our statement of operations in a period of such change. changes in accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations. generally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance, for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets, leases, income taxes and stock-based compensation are complex and involve subjective judgments. changes in these rules or changes in the underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material impact on our results of operations. for example, proposed authoritative guidance for lease accounting, once finalized and enacted, may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. the effects of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or other unforeseen wide-scale events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. the continued threat of terrorism and the associated heightened security measures and military actions in response to acts of terrorism has disrupted commerce and has intensified uncertainties in the u.s. economy. any further acts of terrorism, a future war or a widespread natural disaster may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could 16 table of contents negatively impact our sales revenue by causing consumer spending and/or mall traffic to decline. furthermore, an act of terrorism or war, or the threat thereof, or any other natural disaster that results in unforeseen interruptions of commerce, could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from our vendors. we are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business. from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. these may relate to, for example, trademark, servicemark, copyright or other intellectual property matters, employment law matters, commercial disputes, consumer protection claims, claims of regulatory authorities, or other matters. in addition, as a public company we could from time to time face claims relating to corporate or securities law matters. in connection with such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies. any of such litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant, could be costly and time consuming and could divert management and key personnel from our regular business operations. we do not currently believe that any of our outstanding litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. however, due to the uncertainty of litigation and depending on the amount and the timing of any claims, an unfavorable resolution of such claims could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. our stockholder rights agreement could delay and discourage the acquisition of more than 10% of shares of our common stock or takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.  we adopted a stockholder rights agreement in november 2013 that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our company or a large block of our common stock in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors, even if such acquisition might be favored by certain of our stockholders. a third party that acquires 10% (15% in the case of a passive institutional investor) or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the stockholder rights agreement through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. item 1b.  unresolved
