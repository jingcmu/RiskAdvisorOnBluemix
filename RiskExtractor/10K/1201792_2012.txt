item 1a. risk factors   investing in our common stock has a high degree of risk. before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business if we are unable to continue our recent revenue and earnings growth, our stock price may decline and we may not have adequate financial resources to execute our business plan.   our revenue increased 39% from $107.1 million in 2008 to $149.0 million in 2009, 33% from $149.0 million in 2009 to $198.2 million in 2010, and 31% from $198.2 to $260.4 in 2011 primarily due to strong referrals from current students, new student marketing, and the variety and affordability of our program offerings. the same factors that led to the growth in revenues also contributed to our net income improving to $40.8 million in 2011 from $29.9 million in 2010. the rate of revenue growth from 2010 to 2011 was at a slower pace than the rate of growth from 2008 to 2010. as our revenue base has grown, our growth rate percentages have declined, and it may continue to decline. you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance. if we are unable to maintain adequate revenue and earnings growth, or if investors react negatively to the slowing of our growth rates, the value of our stock price may decline.     33     our growth may place a strain on our resources that could adversely affect our systems, controls and operating efficiency.   the growth that we have experienced in the past, as well as any future growth that we experience, may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls. we do not have experience scheduling courses and administering programs for more students than our current enrollment, and if growth negatively impacts our ability to do so, the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected, resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals. we also have limited experience adding to our courses, programs and operations through acquisitions. future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems, particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the higher education act of 1965, or the higher education act, as administered by the u.s. department of education, including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act, which we refer to in this annual report as title iv programs. we have described some of the most significant regulatory risks that apply to us, including those related to title iv programs, under the heading “risks related to the regulation of our industry” below. if we are unable to manage our growth or successfully carry out and integrate acquisitions, we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.   we have recently experienced, and may in the future experience to a greater degree, increases in our administrative and technology infrastructure expenses, our exposure to bad debt and unpredictability in enrollment. since gaining access to title iv programs, a significant portion of our growth is attributable to students using title iv programs.  this has led to a change in the mix of students that we serve, which has resulted, and will continue to result, in a need to provide a greater level of services to our students.  our costs and expenses have increased due in part to increased general and administrative expenses related to this shift in student mix and primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures for financial aid processing fees, expenditures for technology required to support the increase in civilian students, and increased bad debt primarily associated with our civilian students.  in order to support the number of students we now have and to plan for the future, we also expect that we will make significant investments in our technology infrastructure and financial aid processing capabilities, which from time to time, will result in an increased level of spending, not all of which can be capitalized. the change in our student mix has also made it harder for us to make long range forecasts about student enrollments.  we have had more difficulty forecasting the number of students who will enroll and have noticed a decrease in the predictability of the rate at which we convert leads into enrolled students, which we attribute, in part, to the growth in civilian students, and particularly the growth in civilian students from outside of public service communities. if we are unable to manage changes in the composition of our student body and control the growth of related expenditures, we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. the ability of military students to enroll in our courses can be impacted by factors that we do not anticipate, which can impact our registrations and make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast expected enrollment. beginning with registrations for the third quarter of 2010, we observed that the growth of our net course registrations from active duty military students slowed more than we expected.  we do not know all of the factors that caused this to occur.  we believe that the changes we saw in net course registrations from active duty military students were in part due to increased operations activity and overseas deployments across all branches of the us military, particularly the level of activity in the united states marine corps.  we believe that increased demands on many active duty military personnel, combined with limited internet access associated with some deployments, impacted the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education in 2010. due to the variability of military activity and other factors over which we have no control, the difficulty in predicting military enrollments that we encountered in 2010 could continue in the future or become more pronounced. in addition, over the next several years the number of active and reserve military professionals is likely to decrease if, as proposed, the military downsizes its forces incrementally from a 1.4% reduction in federal fiscal 2013 to a 5.5% reduction in federal fiscal 2017. any decline in the enrollments, or decline in the growth of enrollments, from active duty military students could have an adverse impact on our total net course registrations and revenues. tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel constituted 41% of our adjusted net course registrations for 2011, and our revenues and number of students would decrease if we are no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or tuition assistance is reduced or eliminated.   service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of the armed forces that they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. service members of the united states armed forces can use tuition assistance at postsecondary schools that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the u.s. secretary of education.  we rely for a significant portion of our revenues on the tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel.  our tuition is currently structured so that tuition assistance payments for service members fully cover the service member’s per semester credit hour tuition cost of our undergraduate courses and cover more than 75% of the per course tuition cost of our graduate courses.  if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated, our enrollments and revenues would be significantly reduced resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a recent congressional investigation of department of defense, or dod, tuition assistance programs used for distance education and proprietary institutions and a dod rulemaking that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active service members could result in legislation that limits in whole or in part our participation in the tuition assistance program. in january 2012, senators harkin and durbin introduced legislation that would modify the higher education act’s 90/10 rule.  under the higher education act, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving from title iv funds, on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year, more than 90% of its revenues (as computed for 90/10 rule purposes).  the proposed legislation would decrease the limit to 85% and would count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward that limit. in february 2012, companion bills were introduced in the u.s. senate and u.s. house of representatives that would modify the 90/10 rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educations benefits toward the 90% limit, along with title iv programs.  see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on these developments. in october 2011, the marine corps announced, and later rescinded, new tuition assistance rules that cut the maximum benefit for its service members from $4,500 per year to $875 per year and reduced the tuition assistance from $250 per credit hour to $175 per credit hour.  although undergraduate tuition assistance levels have been restored to their prior levels with retroactive benefits to affected service members, the marine corps has warned that the current levels of funding are not sustainable.  the marine corps did reduce graduate level tuition assistance from $350 per credit hour to $250 per credit hour, which is consistent with the current tuition assistance payments from the other military services. we anticipate that the other services will also consider potential changes to the tuition assistance program.  by february 20, 2012, dod is required to submit a report to the senate and house armed services committees on how to increase the efficiency of tuition assistance program funding, including the impact of changing the program to require service members to pay 25% of their tuition expenses.     34     in addition, in october 2011, dod announced that while it will maintain the current levels of tuition assistance in the near term, it plans to consider changes as part of a holistic review of the military compensation package.  we believe modifications to the tuition assistance program may include a reduced per credit tuition benefit (currently $250), a decrease in the annual cap (currently $4,500), and/or require that service members pay out-of-pocket for a portion of their tuition, among other possible changes. if tuition assistance payments are reduced, we believe that most service members would be eligible and able to finance out-of-pocket tuition costs resulting from this shortfall using their “top up” benefits under the gi bills, which allow service members to use a portion of their gi bill benefits while still on active duty.  however, we do not know whether in the long-term service members would be willing to use the top-up option, or whether the increased administrative process in using the top-up option or covering the shortfall through other funding sources would lead to service members deciding not to enroll or enrolling at a slower rate. we are not able to estimate the effect of future expected changes to the tuition assistance programs or whether the services would impose other criteria in addition to the level of reimbursement that would impact enrollments from service members.   we are also not able to estimate the response that our competitors would take to reduced tuition assistance payments or the willingness of service members to use their top-up option available to them under their veterans benefits.  in this regard, our competitors, particularly those with larger student populations or a smaller concentration of students from the military, may be better situated to lower the cost of tuition to service members.   if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated, our enrollments and revenues could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   strong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.   postsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive. we compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. public and private colleges and universities, as well as other for-profit schools, offer programs similar to those we offer. public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. accordingly, public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for-profit sector. in addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities and other for-profit schools, have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students, particularly in the non-military sector of the market. we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including established colleges and universities that have not previously offered online education programs. in addition, we believe that for-profit schools may increasingly be seeking to attract military students, including because these schools may see it as helpful in their efforts to comply with the 90/10 rule, as currently dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits do not count towards the 90% limit. as stated above, recently introduced legislation would, however, count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward that limit.   we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations. we may also face increased competition if our competitors pursue relationships with the military and governmental educational programs with which we already have relationships. these competitive factors could cause our enrollments, revenues and profitability to decrease significantly. if we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our future growth may be impaired.   the updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers. if we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. to offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. in addition, effective july 1, 2011, under the new regulations published on october 29, 2010, we must notify, and, if required, obtain approval from, the u.s. department of education before we introduce any new program that prepares students for gainful employment. see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on these new program approval requirements. if we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.     35     establishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments in management, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. we may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to modify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. if we are unable to increase the number of students, or offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.   if we do not have adequate continued personal referrals and marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness among, attracting and retaining new students, our financial performance in the future would suffer.   building awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer among potential students is critical to our ability to attract new students. in order to maintain and increase our revenues and profits, we must continue to attract new students in a cost-effective manner and these students must remain active in our programs.  in addition, because we experience declines in our student population as a result of graduation, transfers to other academic institutions, military deployments and other reasons, in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those that have left amu or apu.  beginning in 2009 and continuing into 2011, we increased the amounts spent on marketing and advertising, and we anticipate this trend to continue, particularly as a result of our attempts to attract and retain students from non-military market sectors. we use marketing tools such as the internet, exhibits at conferences, and print media advertising to promote our schools and programs. additionally, we rely on the general reputation of amu and apu and referrals from current students, alumni and educational service officers in the united states armed forces as a source of new students. some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:     •  the emergence of more successful competitors;       •  factors related to our marketing, including the costs of internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;         •  limits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the new incentive payment rule (see “risks related to the regulation of our industry”);     •  performance problems with our online systems;       •  failure to maintain accreditation;       •  student dissatisfaction with our services and programs;       •  failure to develop a message or image that resonates well within non-military sectors of the market;       •  adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors or online or for-profit education generally;       •  adverse developments in our relationship with military educational service officers;       •  a decline in the acceptance of online education; and       •  a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs. to continue to grow our enrollment, we expect to continue to increase the amounts that we spend on marketing and advertising as our traditional approach to marketing and advertising may not be able to sustain meaningful growth rates.  however, because we are smaller than most of our competitors and because our tuition is generally lower, we have fewer dollars available to spend on marketing and advertising than they do. accordingly, we may find it increasingly difficult to continue to compete and grow our enrollments. if we are unable to continue to develop awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain students in both military and non-military market sectors, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired.   system disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.   the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our online classroom, damaging our ability to generate revenue. our technology infrastructure could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist activities and telecommunications failures.     36     our systems, particularly those related to our partnership-at-a-distance, or pad, system, have been predominantly developed in-house, with limited support from outside vendors. we are continuously working on upgrades to the pad system, and our employees continue to devote substantial time to its development. to the extent that we face problems with the pad system, we may not have the capacity to address the problems with our internal capability, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system.   any failure of our online classroom system could also prevent students from accessing their courses. any interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.   our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. we engage multiple security assessment providers on a periodic basis to review and assess our security. we utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are continually monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure. however, we cannot assure you that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches.   system disruptions to our online classroom and technology infrastructure could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.   historically, our online classroom employed the educator™ learning management system pursuant to a license from ucompass.com, inc. we determined that it was in our long-term best interest to transition to a new online classroom that allows us to integrate additional technologies and resources, and in 2010 we began the migration to the sakai collaboration and learning environment (cle), an open-source learning management system, as the foundational software for our online classroom.  our online classroom is central to our operations, and the process of switching to sakai cle was complicated and time consuming, involving customization and integration with the rest of our technology infrastructure.  the migration was completed in early september 2011.  shortly after the completion of the migration, we experienced periods of unplanned downtime in our online classroom during periods of peak utilization.  we believe that in mid-october 2011 we identified the cause of this downtime and took appropriate steps to mitigate the problem.  however, we cannot be certain that we have completely resolved the situation or that similar problems will not occur in the future.   while there are reportedly more than 350 educational institutions around the world using sakai cle to support teaching, learning, research and collaboration, we believe that of the institutions using sakai cle, very few, if any, have a larger number of concurrent users than we do.  this means that there are a limited number of other institutions with whom we can compare best practices for use in similar circumstances to ours.  furthermore, to the extent that we face problems with the online classroom in the future, we may not have the ability to address the problems adequately with internal resources, particularly given our limited history using the software, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our customized system.   the performance and reliability of our online classroom and technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students.  any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our online classroom, preventing students from accessing their courses and damaging our ability to generate revenue. any significant or ongoing interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.   any of the foregoing problems could result in an adverse impact on our operations, damage to our reputation and limits on our ability to attract and retain students. future growth or increased technology demands will require continued investment of capital, time and resources to develop and update our technology and if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources appropriately, our ability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.    our rate of growth  and expectations for the future require us to increase the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure. increasing the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure will require us to invest capital, time and resources, which  we expect from time to time will lead to increased spending on technology infrastructure.  there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment our systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth. we may also need to invest capital, time and resources to update our technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace. if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources or update our resources appropriately, our ability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. similarly, even if we are able to increase the capacity of our resources and update our resources appropriately, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an increased level of spending.     37   the loss of any key member of our management team may impair our ability to operate effectively and may harm our business.   our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business. except for the employment agreements we have with dr. boston, our president and chief executive officer, dr. powell, our executive vice president and provost, dr. van wyk, our executive vice president and chief operations officer, and mr. wilkins, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, we do not have employment agreements with any of our other executive officers or key personnel.   if we are unable to attract and retain management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed.   to execute our growth strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel. competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas. our growth places constant demands on us to find qualified individuals across all levels of our institution. since august 2009, we have hired a new chief operations officer and chief information officer, reflecting our continued need to expand and strengthen our management as we grow.  we also promoted dr. powell, who previously served as academic dean of apus, to executive vice president and provost following the retirement of dr. mccluskey as of march 17, 2011.  if we fail to attract new management, faculty, administrators or skilled personnel or fail to retain and motivate our existing management, faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed. the u.s. department of education’s revised incentive payment rule, which took effect july 1, 2011, may affect the manner in which we attract, retain, and motivate new and existing employees. see “risks related to the regulation of our industry” for additional information on this revised rule. if we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs or department of defense tuition assistance programs or have our participation in the title iv programs conditioned or limited.  we have been the target of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs, and as we continue to grow we may be susceptible to an increased risk of such activities. the potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of title iv program funds by apus, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our nature as an online education provider and our relatively low tuition. we must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.  we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with our growth. grants and loans to students under the federal government’s title iv programs are primarily awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can be expected to contribute to that cost. in order to account for living expenses and other costs that our students may reasonably incur in the context of pursuing a degree or certificate, the cost of attending american public university system is an amount that exceeds the cost of our tuition.  while some students elect to receive grants and loans that cover only the cost of tuition, others elect to receive amounts up to the full cost of attendance.  when apus receives title iv funds from the federal government on a student’s behalf, it credits those funds to the student’s account.  if a student has elected to receive funds in excess of the cost of tuition and fees, a title iv credit balance occurs, and american public university system must pay that credit balance to the student unless the student has authorized american public university system to hold the credit balance or take other permissible action with respect to the credit balance. the availability of title iv funds, including the title iv credit balance payment, is an important part of enabling some students to pursue a degree or certificate.  however, some individuals seek to take advantage of the availability of title iv funds by enrolling for the purpose of obtaining such funds.  on september 26, 2011, the department of education’s inspector general released a report about an increasing number of cases involving large, loosely affiliated groups of individuals, so-called “fraud rings”, who conspire to defraud the title iv programs through enrollment in distance education programs. these fraud rings are taking advantage of the availability of title iv credit balance payments where the cost of attendance exceeds the cost of tuition and fees.  we have been the target of fraudulent activity by individuals and groups with respect to student enrollment and the title iv programs, and given our continued growth and status as an online education provider and our relatively low tuition, we believe that we will increasingly be subject to such activities.  we must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and title iv aid.  we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will be adequate in the face of increasing and increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with our growth. in addition to those who enroll or attempt to enroll solely to obtain title iv funds, some students who might not otherwise pursue a degree or certificate are attracted to enroll because of the availability of title iv funds and economic hardships resulting from today’s economic climate.  we believe these students may be more likely than other students to cease pursuing a degree or certificate due to other factors, such as becoming employed or not having the level of commitment necessary to complete successfully the required coursework. as a result of all of the above factors, the growth in our enrollments reflects some students who will not persist as students.  we have also been the target of fraudulent activities by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and title iv programs, and as we continue to grow, we may be susceptible to an increase of such activities. we are not able to estimate the number of students who fall into these categories, and we are not able to estimate the impact on our enrollments over time, or any additional impact that this could have on our exposure to bad debt or the number of our students who default on their title iv student loans.     38   the department of education requires institutions that participate in title iv programs to refer to the office of the inspector general of the department of education credible information about fraud or other illegal conduct involving title iv programs, and in the past we have referred to the office of the inspector general information with respect to potential fraud by applicants. if the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, or our cohort default rates exceed specified levels or we otherwise do not have procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds, the department of education may find that we do not satisfy its “administrative capability” requirements. this could result in our being limited in our access to, or our losing, title iv program funding, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations.  in addition, our ability to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces is conditioned on our maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education. any significant failure to detect adequately fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause us to fail to meet our accrediting agencies’ standards. furthermore, under the higher education opportunity act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs like ours must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. failure to meet our accrediting agencies’ standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of our accrediting agencies, which could result in a loss of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces.  the protection of our operations through exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property is limited, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties, any of which could harm our operations and prospects.   in the ordinary course of our business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, or other protections. this intellectual property includes but is not limited to course materials, business know-how, and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies. we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect our intellectual property. we rely on service mark and trademark protection in the united states and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to the marks “american military university,” “american public university,” “american public university system” and “educating those who serve,” as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. we rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third party content experts. we cannot assure you that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the united states or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content, and offer competing programs to ours.   in particular, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online resource material, quality management, and other proprietary content. any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs.   we may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. in july 2006, we settled a dispute with another institution regarding the use of certain marks that allowed us to continue to use the marks at issue, but we may not be able to favorably resolve future disputes. some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. our general liability and cyber liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages, which may be significant. we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.   in some instances, our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third party content on class discussion boards. we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. our faculty members or students could also post classified material on class discussion boards, which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our reputation and relationships with members of the military and government. our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.     39     because we are an exclusively online provider of education, we are entirely dependent on continued growth and acceptance of exclusively online education and, if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.   we believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees from online institutions. if students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides value, or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. because our business model is based on online education, if the acceptance of online education does not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   if we do not maintain continued strong relationships with various military bases and educational service officers, and if we are unable to expand our use of articulation agreements, our future growth may be impaired.   we have non-exclusive articulation agreements or memoranda of understanding with various educational institutions of the united states armed forces and other governmental education programs. articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are agreements pursuant to which we agree to award academic credits toward our degrees for learning in educational programs offered by others. additionally, we rely on relationships with educational service offices on military bases and base education officers to distribute our information to interested service members. if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate or end, our efforts to recruit students from that base will be impaired. if our articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are eliminated, or if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate, this could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.   in august 2010, dod issued a proposed rule that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active service members. the proposed rules would require all institutions to sign a memorandum of understanding, or mou, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and dod prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program. the requirements to enter into an mou and the related increased focus by the dod on relationships and oversight of educational providers could lead to changes in the nature of our relationships with military bases and educational service officers, which could be adverse in nature. we have entered into a standard mou with dod the united states armed forces has in the past and may in the future approve programs and initiatives to provide additional educational opportunities to service members, and these programs and initiatives may not include participation by us. we cannot predict the impact of these announcements, programs, or initiatives on us, but given our dependence on students from the armed forces, our net course registrations, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by such announcements, programs, and initiatives.   government regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.   the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services have led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. these new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices, and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. new laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations. risks related to the regulation of our industry if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations, including loss of access to federal tuition assistance programs for members of the united states armed forces and federal loans and grants for our students.   we are subject to extensive regulation by (1) the federal government through the u.s. department of education and under the higher education act, the department of defense and the department of veterans affairs, (2) state regulatory bodies, and (3) accrediting agencies recognized by the u.s. secretary of education. the regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional, and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and financial condition. these regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.   institutions of higher education that grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies. in addition, in certain states as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees and other credentials and in order to participate in various federal programs, including tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces, a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education. accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution. the higher education act requires accrediting agencies recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution’s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency’s standards.     40     our operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in title iv programs. title iv programs, which are administered by the department of education, include loans made directly to students by the department of education. title iv programs also include several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the higher education act and department of education regulations. to participate in title iv programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education, and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education. our growth strategy is partly dependent on enrolling more students who are attracted to us because of our continued participation in these programs.   the regulations, standards, and policies of the department of education, state education agencies, and our accrediting agencies change frequently. recent and pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, activities, receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces, our ability to participate in title iv programs, or costs of doing business. furthermore, findings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards, and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages, or being subjected to fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our operations, termination of our ability to grant degrees, revocation of our accreditation, restrictions on our access to title iv program funds, or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business.   if we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and also to participate in title iv programs.   american public university system is accredited by the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools, one of six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education, and by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council, or detc, which is a national accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education. accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education is required for participation in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces. in 2011, we derived approximately 41% of our revenue from net course registrations from these tuition assistance programs. accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education for title iv purposes is also required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in title iv programs. american public university system achieved regional accreditation from the higher learning commission in 2006 and has had national accreditation from the distance education and training council since 1995. we have identified the higher learning commission as our primary accreditor for title iv purposes. either the higher learning commission or detc may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation. to remain accredited american public university system must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources, and financial stability. failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agencies. furthermore, many prospective students may view accreditation by a regional accrediting agency to be more prestigious than accreditation by a national accrediting agency, and we believe that loss of regional accreditation may reduce the marketability of american public university system even if national accreditation were maintained. the complete loss of accreditation would, among other things, render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces or title iv programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations. our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations.   accreditation by the higher learning commission is an important attribute of our university system. colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate’s credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.  in addition, certain of our individual programs are accredited by specialized accrediting agencies.  if we fail to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting agencies, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on us. increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education and the u.s. congress may result in increased scrutiny of institutions, particularly proprietary institutions, by accrediting agencies, and if our institutional accrediting agency loses its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for title iv program purposes, we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs. in november and december 2009, the department of education’s office of the inspector general, or oig, issued reports criticizing three regional accreditors – middle states commission on higher education, the southern association of colleges and schools, and the higher learning commission – for failing to define both program length and credit hours. oig, in an unusual action, recommended that the department of education consider limiting, suspending, or terminating the higher learning commission’s recognition as an accreditor for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in response, department of education staff conducted a special review of the higher learning commission and required the higher learning commission to accept a corrective action plan. the higher learning commission received additional scrutiny in june 2010 during a house education and labor committee hearing focused on oig’s findings with regard to credit hour policies.     41   in december 2010, the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity, or naciqi, the panel charged with advising the department of education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for title iv purposes, reviewed the higher learning commission’s status as a recognized accrediting agency. based on the higher learning commission’s response to the department’s special review and a december 2008 interim report (which responded to a 2007 naciqi review unrelated to the oig findings), naciqi voted to continue the higher learning commission’s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to submit an additional compliance report in one year. at its december 2011 meeting, naciqi characterized the higher learning commission’s report as “informational” and noted that no vote was to be taken on it. we are currently unaware of what further action naciqi might take with respect to the higher learning commission and its compliance report. naciqi is next scheduled to review the higher learning commission for recognition purposes in spring 2013. scrutiny of accrediting agencies and their accreditation of proprietary institutions is likely to continue. if the department of education were to limit, suspend, or terminate the higher learning commission’s recognition, we could lose our ability to participate in the title iv programs, unless and until we were able to obtain department of education approval to rely on detc accreditation for purposes of institutional eligibility to participate in the title iv programs. if we were unable to rely on detc accreditation in such circumstances, among other things, our students and our institution would be ineligible to participate in the title iv programs, and such consequence would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, and results of operations. in addition, increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education in connection with the department of education’s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies. furthermore, because the for-profit education sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it is possible that accrediting bodies would respond to that growth by adopting additional criteria, standards, and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate, or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like us. for example, in june 2009, the higher learning commission adopted new policies related to institutional control, structure, and organization.  part of the higher learning commission’s rationale for these changes was to better define the range of its oversight of transactions related to change of ownership at institutions. the new policies extend the higher learning commission’s oversight to transactions that change, or have the potential to change, the control of an institution or its fundamental structure and organization. under the new policies, the higher learning commission also now extends its oversight to defined changes that occur in a parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock, could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the higher learning commission and possible change from an accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks of these types of actions. in particular, the change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution’s ability to participate in title iv programs. for-profit institutions may also be less attractive acquisition candidates because the higher learning commission has enhanced its scrutiny of change in control transactions, obtained the explicit ability to move an institution from accredited status to candidate status, and will be examining more closely entities that own accredited institutions. new and anticipated regulations published by the u.s. department of education could result in regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business. on june 18, 2010, the department of education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“nprm”) in respect of many of the issues subject to the negotiated rulemaking process, other than the metrics for determining compliance with the gainful employment requirement.  on july 26, 2010, the department of education issued an nprm in respect of the gainful employment requirement.  on october 29, 2010, the department of education published final regulations concerning certain institutional eligibility issues (such as state authorization for postsecondary education institutions), definitional issues (such as the definition of “credit hour” for certain eligibility and other purposes), student eligibility issues (including the validity of high school diplomas), and other title iv provisions (such as gainful employment program reporting and disclosure, incentive payment and misrepresentation), as well as final regulations to establish a process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.  these final regulations were generally effective july 1, 2011.  on june 13, 2011, the department of education published final regulations on metrics for gainful employment programs effective july 1, 2012. the new regulations are described above in “regulation of title iv financial aid programs - recent regulatory changes.” on may 5, 2011, the department of education announced its intention to establish additional negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare proposed regulations under the higher education act. three public hearings were conducted in may 2011 at which interested parties suggested issues that should be considered for action by the negotiating committees. the department of education also conducted roundtable discussions to inform policy in the areas of teacher preparation, college completion, and the proposed “first in the world” competition. in january 2012, two negotiated rulemaking committees -- one on teacher preparation and one on student loans held meetings to discuss possible amendments to department of education regulations. the committee on title iv loan programs is charged with (1) streamlining the loan program regulations by repealing unnecessary ffel program regulations and incorporating and modifying necessary requirements within the direct loan program as a result of the ffel program’s termination; (2) addressing possible changes in the regulations governing the income-contingent and income-based prepayment plans and the process for making total and permanent disability determinations; (3) drafting various regulations applicable to the administration of the federal perkins loan program; (4) modifying rules regarding closed schools and related student withdrawals;  and (5) addressing various regulations related to forbearance and default, including mandatory granting of forbearance to direct loan borrowers eligible for partial repayment of loans by the dod. the committee on teacher preparation is charged with recommending institutional and state reporting requirements on teacher preparation program quality and with determining the criteria that states should use to assess teacher preparation programs and to identify those that are not performing well. it will also address issues related to teach grants. apus offers a state-approved educator certification program in west virginia and is therefore subject to the regulations that are being negotiated.     42   if our efforts to comply with the new and pending regulations are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions, due to uncertainty about the meaning of the rules or otherwise, we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds. we cannot predict with certainty the effect the new and pending regulatory provisions will have on our business. a number of the risk factors below address potential substantive concerns and risks with respect to the new regulations, commonly referred to as the program integrity regulations. with respect to the final regulations generally, and each of the regulations discussed in the risk factors below specifically, we cannot predict how the final regulations will be interpreted. compliance with any of these new rules or uncertainty that results from the rules being recently promulgated and the absence of past practice and limited guidance as to the implementation of these new rules could have an adverse impact on our enrollment, affect the manner in which we do business, increase our cost of doing business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. lack of clarity in the final rules or guidance by the department of education could result in uncertainties continuing for some period of time, and may require us to adopt overly-narrow practices until clarity is obtained, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected. a failure to meet standards regarding “gainful employment” may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in title iv programs. on june 13, 2011, the department of education published final regulations on gainful employment programs effective july 1, 2012. if a program fails all three of the gainful employment metrics in a given year, the u.s. department of education requires the institution to disclose the amount by which the program under-performed the metrics and the institution’s plan for program improvement. also, the institution must establish a three-day waiting period for enrollment after the warning information is given. should a program fail to achieve the metrics twice within three years, the institution must continue to provide the first year disclosures and, among other things, also disclose to current and prospective students that they should expect to have difficulty repaying their student loans; provide an explanation of the risks associated with enrolling or continuing in the program, including the potential consequences for, and options available to, the student if the program becomes ineligible for title iv funds; and explain the resources available to research other educational options and compare program costs. should a program fail three times within a four year period, the department of education would terminate the program’s eligibility for federal student aid (i.e., students in the program would immediately lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs), and the institution would not be able to reestablish the program’s eligibility for at least three years, though the program could continue to operate without title iv funding. the earliest a program could lose eligibility under the gainful employment rule will be 2015, based on its 2012, 2013, and 2014 performance under the metrics.   because the department of education’s gainful employment rules will be implemented over several years and are based at least in part on data that is unavailable to us, it is not possible at this time to determine with any degree of certainty whether these new regulations will cause any of our programs to become ineligible to participate in the title iv programs. however, under this new regulation, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for title iv funding is at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans, and other factors. in addition, even though deficiencies in the metrics may be correctible on a timely basis, the disclosure requirements to students following a failure to meet the standards may adversely impact enrollment in that program and may adversely impact the reputation of our educational institutions.     our failure to obtain department of education approval, where required, for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation could materially and adversely affect our business. on october 29, 2010, the department of education issued final regulations to establish a new process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. under the final regulations, which became effective july 1, 2011, an institution must notify the department of education at least 90 days before the first day of class when it intends to add a program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.  the institution seeking approval may proceed to offer the program, unless the department of education advises the institution at least 30 days before the first day of classes that the department of education must approve the program for title iv purposes.  if the department of education denies approval, the institution may not award title iv funds in connection with the program. on september 27, 2011, the department of education issued an nprm that proposed to define a smaller group of gainful employment programs for which an institution must obtain approval from the department, including only programs that are the same as or substantially similar to programs performing poorly under the gainful employment metrics. were the department to deny approval to one or more of our new programs, our business could be materially and adversely affected. furthermore, compliance with these new procedures could cause delay in our ability to offer new programs and put our business at a competitive disadvantage. compliance could also adversely affect our ability to timely offer programs of interest to our students and potential students and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.     43     our failure to comply with the department of education’s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions. if we pay a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of applicable department of education rules, we could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education abolished 12 safe harbors that described permissible arrangements under the regulation.  the amended regulation was effective july 1, 2011. abolition of the safe harbors and other aspects of the new regulation may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments. the modified incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may affect negatively our ability to recruit and retain employees, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, the government accountability office, or gao, has issued a report critical of the department of education’s enforcement of the incentive payment rule, and the department of education has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts. if the department of education determines that an institution violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to the department of education’s satisfaction. the department of education may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution’s participation in the title iv programs. the department of education may also seek to recover title iv funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. in addition, third parties may file “qui tam” or “whistleblower” suits on behalf of the department of education alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. such suits may prompt department of education investigations. particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the new incentive payment rule, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or department of education investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline and could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, among other things. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected our failure to comply with the department of education’s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in sanctions. the department of education may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education has expanded the activities that constitute a substantial misrepresentation, effective july 1, 2011. under the final regulation, an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to the secretary of education. the final regulations define misrepresentation as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, and they define a misleading statement as any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse. the final regulations define substantial misrepresentation as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to the person’s detriment. if the department of education determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the department of education may revoke an institution’s program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institution’s participation in the title iv programs, deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution, or initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or termination the institution’s participation in the title iv programs.  we expect that there could be an increase in our industry of administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation, which at a minimum would increase legal costs associated with defending such actions, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected. failure to comply with the department of education’s credit hour requirements could result in sanctions. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education has defined “credit” hour for title iv purposes.  the credit hour is used for title iv purposes to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of title iv aid that an institution may disburse in a payment period. the final regulations define credit hour as an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and out of class or an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities. the final regulations also require institutional accreditors to review an institution’s policies, procedures, and administration of policies and procedures for assignment of credit hours. an accreditor must take appropriate actions to address an institution’s credit hour deficiencies and to notify the department of education if it finds systemic noncompliance or significant noncompliance in one or more programs. the department of education has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for title iv purposes, it may require the institution to repay the amount of title iv awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and, if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours, it may fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in title iv programs, as a result of which our business could be materially and adversely affected.     44   failure to comply with the department of education’s state authorization rules could result in our students being ineligible for title iv programs. to be eligible for title iv programs, an institution must be legally authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in which it is physically located. in the final regulations published on october 29, 2010, the department of education specified the type of state approvals that are acceptable for an institution to demonstrate that it is legally authorized by the state in which it is located.  the regulations also provide that states must also have mechanisms to take appropriate action against institutions and to respond to complaints.   the final rule provided that if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located, the institution must meet state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state.  that rule was effective on july 1, 2011, although in an april 2011 guidance letter the department of education indicated that it would not initiate any action to establish repayment liabilities or limit student eligibility for distance education activities undertaken before july 1, 2014, provided the institution was making a good faith effort to identify and obtain necessary state authorization before that date.  on july 12, 2011, a federal judge for the u.s. district court for the district of columbia vacated the department of education’s portion of the state authorization regulation that requires online education providers to obtain any required authorizations from all states in which their students reside, finding that the department of education had failed to provide sufficient notice and opportunity for comment on the requirement. should the requirement be enforced, however, and if we fail to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a state, we could lose our ability to award title iv aid to students in that state. if the department of education determines that an institution does not have the required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a state, the institution could lose its ability to award title iv funds to students in that state. the new distance education rules could also lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices detrimental to institutions such as ours. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected. currently, american public university system is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission. in addition, we are authorized in numerous states to offer postsecondary distance education to students in those states. it is possible that west virginia and other states could, as a result of the limited amount of time for states to evaluate and implement the department of education’s final state authorization rule or otherwise, adopt standards that are detrimental to institutions such as ours. as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected. if american public university system does not maintain its authorization in west virginia, our operations would be curtailed, and we may not grant degrees. american public university system is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission to grants degrees, diplomas and certificates. the west virginia higher education policy commission may also take disciplinary action or revoke authorization if an institution’s bond is cancelled, if the institution fails to take corrective action to bring it into compliance with west virginia higher education policy commission policies, or if the owner is convicted for a felony or crime involving institution administration of title iv programs. under current law, if we were to lose our regional accreditation by the higher learning commission, we could continue our state authorization based on our national accrediting agency, detc, if the west virginia higher education policy commission finds that it is an acceptable alternative accrediting agency. if we were to lose accreditation from both accrediting agencies, or accreditation by detc is not an acceptable alternative accrediting agency in case of loss of the higher learning commission accreditation, the west virginia higher education policy commission may suspend, withdraw, or revoke our authorization. in addition, in order to maintain our eligibility for accreditation by the higher learning commission, we must remain headquartered and have a substantial presence in one of the states in its region, which includes west virginia. thus, if we were to lose our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission, we would be unable to provide educational services in west virginia, we would lose our eligibility for title iv programs, and we would lose our regional accreditation. our failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations.   various states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. several states assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. state regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. as such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators. american public university system has a physical presence in the commonwealth of virginia based on administrative offices in that state, and it is authorized by the state council of higher education for virginia. american public university system has established a regulatory relationship with 49 of the 50 states, plus the district of columbia, and we are in the process of confirming our compliance with the remaining state’s recently revised regulatory provisions. state laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. to the extent that we have obtained, or obtain in the future, additional authorizations or licensure, changes in state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education, the west virginia higher education policy commission, the higher learning commission, or detc. if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. if we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, we may be the subject of injunctive actions or penalties. although we believe that the only state licensure or authorization that is necessary currently for american public university system to participate in the tuition assistance programs for the united states armed forces and in title iv programs is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission, loss of licensure or authorization in other states or the failure to obtain required licensures or authorizations could prohibit us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states, reduce significantly our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     45     under the department of education’s final regulations published on october 29, 2010, if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined the state, the institution must have met any state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state. the rule was effective july 1, 2011. the department of education indicated in an april 2011 guidance letter that it would not initiate any action to establish repayment liabilities or limit student eligibility for distance education activities undertaken before july 1, 2014, provided the institution is making a good faith effort to identify and obtain necessary state authorization before that date. however, on july 12, 2011, a federal judge for the u.s. district court for the district of columbia vacated the portion of the department of education’s state authorization regulation that requires online education providers to obtain any required authorizations from all states in which their students reside, finding that the department of education had failed to provide sufficient notice and opportunity for comment on the requirement. should the requirement be enforced, however, and if we fail to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state, we could lose our ability to award title iv aid to students in that state. the department of education’s distance-education state authorization requirement could lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices affecting the delivery of distance education to students located in those states. in the event we are found not to be in compliance with a state’s new or existing requirements for offering distance education within that state, the state could seek to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries, we may not be able to recruit students from that state, and may have to cease providing service to students in that state. in addition, under the regulation, if enforced, we could lose eligibility to offer title iv aid to students located in that state. our experience with the title iv programs is limited, because we only began to participate in the programs in 2006, and our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with title iv programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth.   we first became certified to participate in title iv programs for classes beginning in november 2006. we expect a significant portion of our growth in enrollments and revenues to come from students who are utilizing funds from title iv programs. however, compliance with the requirements of the higher education act and title iv programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations, which require additional staff, contractual arrangements, systems and regulatory costs. we have limited demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements. if we fail to comply with any of these additional regulatory requirements, the department of education could, among other things, impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations.    we must periodically seek recertification to participate in title iv programs, and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the department of education prior to seeking recertification, and our future success may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification.   an institution generally must seek recertification from the department of education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. the department of education may also review an institution’s continued eligibility and certification to participate in title iv programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways, such as the addition of certain types of new programs, or, in certain cases, changes to the academic credentials that it offers. in certain circumstances, the department of education must provisionally certify an institution, such as when it is an initial participant in title iv programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control. in 2006, we applied to participate in title iv programs for the first time and were provisionally certified for a period through june 30, 2007. we timely submitted our application for recertification, and the department of education granted us provisional certification through june 30, 2008. in may 2008, we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs. in august 2008, we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs. as required under department of education regulations, we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control. in connection with the department of education’s review of the change, we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation, including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change. on october 2, 2008, we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september 30, 2010.     46   a provisionally certified institution must apply for and receive department of education approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. the department of education may withdraw the institution’s certification if it determines that the institution is not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in title iv programs. in 2010, we applied for recertification and, on july 2, 2010, we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december 31, 2014. if the department of education were to withdraw or not renew our certification to participate in title iv programs, our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations. in addition, regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results.  government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims, or initiate litigation against us, any of which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our performance.   because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. for example, the department of education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in the title iv programs and the office of inspector general of the department of education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. in august 2010, the secretary of education announced in a letter to several members of congress that, in part in response to recent allegations against proprietary institutions of deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations, the department planned to strengthen its oversight of title iv programs through, among other approaches, increasing the number of program reviews by 50%, from 200 conducted in 2010 up to 300 reviews in 2011. if the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of title iv funding, injunctions, or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit.  the u.s. congress has been examining the for-profit postsecondary education sector, which could result in legislation or additional department of education rulemaking that may limit or condition title iv program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.   in recent years, the u.s. congress has increased its focus on for-profit education institutions, including a review of their participation in the title iv programs. since june 2010, the u.s. senate’s health, education, labor and pensions committee (“help committee”) has held hearings to examine the proprietary education sector. on august 5, 2010, we received a letter from senator tom harkin, chairman of the help committee, requesting documents as part of a review of matters related to for-profit postsecondary education institutions whose students receive federal student financial aid. we understand that the request was one of approximately thirty requests made to for-profit colleges in connection with the help committee’s review of matters related to for-profit colleges participating in title iv programs. in june 2010, the education and labor committee of the u.s. house of representatives held a hearing to examine accreditors’ standards and procedures pertinent to higher education institutions’ policies on credit hours and program length. during the hearing, some committee members voiced concerns about the growing proportion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions. on june 21, the chairmen of each of the senate and house education committees, together with other members of congress, requested the gao to conduct a review and prepare a report with recommendations regarding various aspects of the proprietary education sector, including recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud and abuse in title iv programs, and the degree to which proprietary institutions’ revenue is comprised of title iv and other federal funding sources.  on august 4, the gao released a report based on a three-month undercover investigation of recruiting practices at proprietary institutions, which concluded that employees at a non-random sample of 15 proprietary institutions (which did not include american public university systems) made deceptive statements to students about accreditation, graduation rates, job placement, program costs, or financial aid. on november 30, 2010, the gao issued a revised version of that report that corrected or further explained a number of the instances of allegedly deceptive conduct. we incurred significant legal and other costs to respond to the congressional inquiry, and could incur significant legal and other cost to respond to any future inquiries. on august 4, 2010, the senate help committee held a hearing to examine the student recruitment experience at for-profit postsecondary education institutions, and on september 30, 2010, the senate help committee held a hearing in regard to the federal investment in for-profit education and the resulting student outcomes. the senate help committee held additional hearings in 2011. on march 10, 2011, the committee held a hearing to present a case study of another for-profit postsecondary education institution, its educational services, and the role of accreditor, state, and federal oversight. a hearing about financial outcomes of students at for-profit colleges was held by the senate help committee on june 7, 2011. at a number of hearings, committee members have expressed concern about the amount of student loan debt taken on by students at for-profit institutions. following those hearings, on july 21, 2011, the committee hosted a roundtable discussion of policy solutions for improving for-profit postsecondary education.     47   on october 31, 2011, the gao released a second report following additional undercover investigation related to enrollment, cost, financial aid, course structure, substandard student performance, withdrawal, and exit counseling. the report concluded that while some of the 15 unidentified for-profit schools investigated appeared to follow existing policies, others did not. although the report identified a number of deficiencies in specific instances, it made no recommendations.  on december 7, 2011, the gao released a report that attempted to compare the quality of education provided by for-profit, nonprofit, and public schools based upon multiple outcome measures including graduation rates, pass rates on licensing exams, employment outcomes, and student loan default rates. the report found that for-profit school students had higher graduation rates for certificate programs, similar graduation rates for associate’s degree programs, and lower graduation rates for bachelor’s degree programs than students at nonprofit and public schools. it also found that a higher proportion of bachelor’s degree recipients from for-profit schools took out loans than did degree recipients from other schools and that there is some evidence that students at for-profits schools default on their student loans at higher rates. on 9 of the 10 licensing exams reviewed, graduates of for-profit schools had lower pass rates than students from nonprofit and public schools. we cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and reviews will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in title iv programs, or more vigorous enforcement of title iv requirements. to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition title iv program participation of proprietary schools or the amount of federal student financial aid for which proprietary school students are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected.     congressional examination of department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance education and proprietary institutions and pending rulemaking by the department of defense could result in legislative or regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business.   in recent years, the u.s. congress has increased its focus on department of defense (“dod”) tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions.  in september 2010, the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the u.s. house of representative’s armed services committee held a hearing titled “a question of quality and value:  department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance learning and for-profit colleges.”  witnesses and subcommittee members expressed concern about dod’s oversight of distance education programs, especially those offered by proprietary institutions.  in august 2010, dod issued a proposed regulation that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active duty service members.  under the proposed regulations, the military installation voluntary education review program would be expanded to institutions offering instruction to service members through distance education, and all institutions would be required to participate in the program. in addition, in december 2010, the senate help committee released a report entitled “benefitting whom? for-profit education companies and the growth of military educational benefits,” which raised questions about the growing share of dod tuition assistance received by proprietary institutions. in march 2011, the gao published a report entitled “dod education benefits: increased oversight of tuition assistance program is needed,” which offered several recommendations for improving accountability within the tuition assistance program. in september 2011, the senate subcommittee on federal financial management, government information, federal services, and international security held a hearing focused on the classification of military education benefits under the “90/10 rule,” which requires proprietary institutions  to derive at least 10 percent of their revenue from non-title iv sources. some of the panelists suggested that the classification of military benefits as non-title iv revenue for purposes of the 90/10 rule has led some for-profit institutions to recruit aggressively and sometimes illegally members of the military in order to ensure compliance with the 90/10 rule. senator harkin, chairman of the senate committee on health, education, labor & pensions spoke on the senate floor on may 19, 2011 and hosted a press conference on september 22, 2011 encouraging reformation of the 90/10 rule. senator harkin has accused for-profit institutions of engaging in deceptive marketing and aggressive recruiting in order to enroll veteran and active duty military members.  he has also criticized for-profit institutions on the basis of their program withdrawal rates and demanded more accountability for the use of federal funds. we cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, congressional hearings will affect dod’s current rulemaking or result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our participation in dod’s tuition assistance program or the title iv programs. members of congress have stated, both in committee hearings and in the help committee report, that congress should revise the 90/10 rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educational benefits toward the 90% limit. in january 2012, senators harkin and durbin introduced a bill to modify the 90/10 rule by reducing the threshold to 85% and counting the title iv programs, the dod tuition assistance program, and veterans education benefits programs as sources from which an institution may derive no more than 85% of its revenue. in february 2012, companion bills were introduced in the u.s. senate and u.s. house of representatives that would modify the 90/10 rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educations benefits toward the 90% limit, along with title iv programs. we cannot predict the likelihood that congress will amend the 90/10 rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the 90% limit or to lower the ratio to 85/15, nor can we predict the likelihood that congress or president obama will not take some other action to limit tuition assistance and veterans education benefits to proprietary institutions. to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition the participation of proprietary schools or distance education programs in dod tuition assistance programs or in title iv programs with respect to dod tuition assistance programs, or that limit or condition the amount of tuition assistance for which proprietary schools or distance education programs are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected.     48   our regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit institutions.   we are one of a number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. in recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for-profit educational institutions. these investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations. these allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of for-profit educational institutions, including american public university system. in addition, in recent years reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education. adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for-profit school sector or regarding us directly could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments, revenues and operating profit, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the department of education, congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures, or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including us. congress may change the law or reduce funding for title iv programs, which could reduce our student population, revenues and profit margin.   the higher education act comes up for reauthorization by congress approximately every five to six years. when congress does not act on complete reauthorization, there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization.    on august 2, 2011, president obama signed the budget control act of 2011, which eliminated direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students, as of july 1, 2012.  on december 23, 2011, president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act of 2012, which made several alterations to federal student aid programs authorized under title iv. in addition, there is no assurance that congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease title iv program funds available to students, including students who attend our institution. any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for title iv programs or the ability of our school or students to participate in these programs would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment. such a decrease in enrollment would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. congressional action  may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin. we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by congress or signed into law in the future. the reallocation of funding among title iv programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different title iv programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.   investigations by state attorneys general, congress, and governmental agencies regarding relationships between loan providers and educational institutions and their financial aid officers may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs.   in recent years, the student lending practices of postsecondary educational institutions, financial aid officers, and student loan providers have been subjected to several investigations by state attorneys general, congress, and governmental agencies. these investigations concern, among other things, possible deceptive practices in the marketing of private student loans and loans provided by lenders pursuant to title iv programs. heoa contains new requirements pertinent to relationships between lenders and institutions. in particular, heoa requires institutions to have a code of conduct, with certain specified provisions, pertinent to interactions with lenders of student loans, prohibits certain activities by lenders and guaranty agencies with respect to institutions, and establishes substantive and disclosure requirements for lists of recommended or suggested lenders of federal and private student loans. in addition, heoa imposes substantive and disclosure obligations on institutions that make available a list of recommended lenders for potential borrowers. state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions. we can neither know nor predict with certainty the effects of such developments. governmental action may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margins. we are subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely title iv program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.   a school participating in title iv programs must calculate correctly the amount of unearned title iv program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. because we began to participate in title iv programs in 2006 and the final regulations published on october 29, 2010 include new rules applicable to return of title iv calculations, we have limited experience complying with these provisions. under department of education regulations, late returns of title iv program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution’s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance. if unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to repay title iv funds, post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education or otherwise be sanctioned by the department of education, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations.     49     a failure to demonstrate “financial responsibility” may result in the loss of eligibility by american public university system to participate in title iv programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   to participate in title iv programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the department of education, or post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions, such as provisional certification, additional reporting requirements, or regulatory oversight, on its participation in title iv programs. the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in title iv programs. any obligation to post a letter of credit could increase our costs of regulatory compliance. if we were unable to secure a letter of credit, we would lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in addition to the obligation to post a letter of credit under certain circumstances, an institution that is determined by the department of education not to be financially responsible may be transferred from the “advance” system of payment of title iv funds, which allows the institution to obtain title iv program funds from the department of education prior to making disbursements to students, to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, which requires the institution to make title iv disbursements to students and seek reimbursement from the department of education. a change in our system of payment could increase our costs of regulatory compliance. if we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs, our students would lose access to title iv program funds for use in our institution, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military community and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.   a failure to demonstrate “administrative capability” may result in the loss of american public university system’s eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   department of education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in title iv programs. see “regulation of our business” in this annual report for more information on the department of education’s regulations on administrative capability.   if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other department of education regulations, the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds, transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs. if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education’s “administrative capability” requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, title iv program funding, which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations. we rely on a third party to administer our participation in title iv programs and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs.   we only began to participate in the title iv programs in 2006, and we have not developed the internal capacity to handle the complex administration of participation in title iv programs without third-party assistance. global financial aid services, inc. assists us with administration of our participation in title iv programs, and if it does not comply with applicable regulations, we may be liable for its actions and could lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs. in addition, if it is no longer able to provide the services to us, we may not be able to replace it in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of title iv programs, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operation.    we may lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs if our student loan default rates are too high, and if we lose that eligibility our future growth could be impaired. an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 25% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year. in addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if its default rate exceeds 40% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which default rates have been calculated by the department of education. heoa modifies the higher education act’s default rate provisions. beginning with default rate calculations for federal fiscal year 2009, the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year. the current method of calculating rates will remain in effect and will be used to determine institutional eligibility until three consecutive years of cohort default rates calculated under the new formula are available. in addition, the cohort default rate threshold of 25% will be increased to 30% for purposes of certain sanctions and requirements related to cohort default rates. heoa also requires certain default prevention action by an institution with a default rate of 30% or more. because we began only recently to enroll students who are participating in the federal student loan programs, we have no historical cohort default rate for federal fiscal year 2007 or earlier. our cohort default rate for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are 5.2% and 4.0%, respectively. relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term, which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our cohort default rate. if american public university system loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs because of high student loan default rates, our students would no longer be eligible to use title iv program funds in our institution, which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     50   if we undergo a change in ownership and control, the department of education will place us on provisional certification, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations. department of education regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if: (1) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form 8-k with the sec disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the department of education to be a change in ownership and control under this standard. under the higher education act, an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility.   during our period of provisional certification, we had to comply with any additional conditions included in our program participation agreement, which included, among other things, limitations on our operations. our program participation agreement provided that, as a provisionally certified institution, we had to apply for and receive approval by the secretary for any substantial change, including but not limited to establishment of additional locations, an increase in the level of academic offering, and addition of any non-degree or short-term training program. the department of education also had authority to review us more closely during our provisional certification. on july 2, 2010, we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december 31, 2014. future transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under department of education regulations and could cause the department to place us on provisional certification as require by the law when an institution undergoes a change in ownership and control. the conditions to provisional certification or closer review by the department of education could impact, among other things, our ability to add educational programs, acquire other schools, or make other significant changes. in addition, if the department of education were to determine that we were unable to meet our responsibilities while we were provisionally certified, the department could seek to revoke our certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections than if we were fully certified. limitations on our operations could, and the loss of our certification to participate in title iv programs would, adversely affect our ability to grow our presence outside the military sector in addition to having adverse effects on our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations. if regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to operate could be impaired.   if we or american public university system experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies, the department of education, detc, the higher learning commission, or other regulators, we must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency. transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution’s common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution’s board of directors. some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the west virginia higher education policy commission, the state council of higher education for virginia, the department of education, detc, or the higher learning commission could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require us to suspend our activities in that state or otherwise impair our operations. the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. in addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares. risks related to owning our common stock   the price of our common stock may be volatile, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.   we completed our initial public offering in november 2007. for a significant portion of the time since our initial public offering, we have had relatively limited public float, and trading in our common stock has also been limited and, at times, volatile. an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.     51     the price of the common stock may fluctuate as a result of:   • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;     • significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;     • actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, enrollments or net course registrations, or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;     • the actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in government policies, laws and regulations, or similar changes made by accrediting bodies;     • the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;     • general economic conditions and trends;     • catastrophic events;     • sales of large blocks of our stock; or     • recruitment or departure of key personnel.   in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business.   seasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year. our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in enrollment. student population varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations and student attrition. while our number of enrolled students has grown in each sequential quarter over the past three years, the number of enrolled students has been proportionally greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year. a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. such patterns may change, however, as a result of new program introductions and increased enrollments of students. these fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations and/or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.   if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.   the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. if one or more of the analysts covering us downgrade their estimates or evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.   provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.   provisions in our charter and bylaws and in the delaware general corporation law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. these provisions include:   • the ability of our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval, which may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company;   • a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of their intention to nominate a director or to propose any other business at an annual meeting of stockholders;   • a prohibition against stockholder action by means of written consent unless otherwise approved by our board of directors in advance; and   • the application of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner.     52     item 1b.    unresolved
