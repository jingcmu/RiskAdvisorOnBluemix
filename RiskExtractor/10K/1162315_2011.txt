item 1a.           risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in forward-looking statements we make about our business. a decline in the travel industry could adversely affect our results of operations. our results of operations depend upon factors affecting the travel industry in general. our enrollments and resulting revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect domestic and international air travel and the level of hotel reservations. a number of factors, including a rise in fuel prices or other travel costs, which if passed along later in the year could decrease our ability to pass these costs onto our participants, reduction of airline capacity causing prices to increase, excessive inflation, currency fluctuations within the global market, the strength of the dollar, foreign taxation changes, extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety could result in a temporary or longer-term overall decline in demand for our programs. also, demand for our products and services may be significantly affected by the general level of economic activity, level of discretionary spending and employment levels in the united states and key international markets. therefore, global economic downturns or recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, impacting cash flows and results of operations. currently, the united states and other markets are facing these conditions which have impacted the travel industry, the markets in which we operate, and our profitability. we expect these conditions will continue to impact our operations and profitability for the foreseeable future. if we are ineffective in our marketing efforts or are unable to generate leads or prospects, our growth and future profitability could be impacted. performance in our travel programs is substantially dependent on the effectiveness of our direct and indirect marketing efforts, including but not limited to, lead sources used to identify potential participants for our programs, direct mail, online presence and local informational meetings. our performance is also dependent on our ability to expand the marketing and volume of our educational travel programs, increase the number of website visitors and unique users, and develop our brands. our ability to grow is dependent on our ability to find and convert leads into enrollments as well as find and integrate acquisitions or strategic alliances. failure or underperformance of our marketing efforts, including changes in the direct-mail environment and the company’s reputation with teachers and potential participants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. such changes in the direct-mail environment could include, but are not limited to, a threat of disease or bioterrorism within the mail environment and new or different regulatory schemes or changes in costs or services by the united states postal service. furthermore, ineffectiveness in our marketing efforts could result in a fluctuation of our operating results, including the mix among five different travel programs and program destinations offered by us and our competitors, the introduction and acceptance of new programs and program enhancements by us and our competitors, timing of program completions, cancellation rates, and marketing expenses. in addition, the performance of our bookrags segment is dependent on where our content shows up in search engine results pages. search engine changes in the results pages that adversely affect our rankings can result in reduced traffic, which would have an impact on operations.  business interruption due to natural occurrences, international political climate, armed conflicts, terrorist activities and threats thereof, and other world events or incidents affecting the health, safety, security and/or program satisfaction of individuals could have an adverse affect on our profitability. demand for our travel programs may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes, earthquakes, epidemics or other disease outbreaks such as influenza, and flooding in geographic regions in which we conduct travel programs. the occurrence of any of the events described above or other unforeseen developments in one or more of these regions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire and/or retain enrollments, which would substantially impact profitability, cash flows, and results of operations.   -9- table of contents   our operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business internationally, as most of our travel programs are conducted outside the united states. potential risks include war, u.s. military deployments, international and domestic terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, foreign currency exchange rates, governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights. periods of international and domestic unrest and various terrorist activities have reduced demand for our travel programs in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations. examples of such past events include, but are not limited to various terrorist attacks, such as the attempted airliner terrorist attack on december 25, 2009,  attacks in london on july 7 and 21, 2005, and in the united states on september 11, 2001. a continued u.s. military response and other acts of violence or war have and will affect the travel industry generally, the markets in which we operate, and our operations and profitability. further terrorist attacks against the united states businesses and citizens at home and abroad may occur. the potential long-term effects of these events are uncertain for our customers, the markets for our services, the market for our common stock, and the u.s. economy. the consequences of these types of events are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or operations. historically, we have experienced increased cancellations for our travel programs during such times. our dependence on travel suppliers could delay the delivery of our products and services, which would impact our reputation and could reduce our profitability. we are dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services. travel suppliers include airlines, hotels, bus lines, overseas coordinators and other participants in the travel industry. consistent with industry practices, we currently have no long-term agreements with travel suppliers that obligate such suppliers to sell services or products through us on an ongoing basis. therefore, the travel suppliers generally can cancel or modify their agreements with us upon relatively short notice. in addition, any decline in the quality of travel products and services provided by these suppliers, or a perception by our participants of such a decline, could adversely affect our reputation and profitability. the loss of contracts, changes in our pricing agreements, commission schedules or incentive override commission arrangements, more restricted access to travel suppliers’ products and services or less favorable public opinion of certain travel suppliers, resulting in low demand for the products and services of such travel suppliers and loss of deposits with travel suppliers that could go bankrupt could all have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our results of operations. many of our arrangements with our foreign-based suppliers require payment to be made in foreign currencies. any decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to foreign currencies has the effect of increasing the cost of the services to be provided and conversely, any increase in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to foreign currencies could result in benefits regarding these costs. since late 1993, we generally have purchased forward contracts and options with less than two years’ maturity to help manage program costs and hedge against foreign currency valuation changes. while the ability to utilize forward contracts for the delivery of foreign currencies can mitigate the effect on program costs and foreign currency exchange fluctuations, there can be no assurance that program costs will not be significantly impacted in future periods. there can also be no assurance our hedging strategy will mitigate longer-term foreign exchange valuation trends. depending on the strength of the u.s. dollar at the time the forward contracts and options are entered into, its strength throughout the contracted period, and the accuracy of our projected volume, we could experience an over-hedged position, which may result in a gain or loss that must be recognized immediately in our consolidated financial statements. .     -10- table of contents      our inability to use established brands, such as the “people to people” and “discovery education” names, could significantly impact our success in attracting future travelers.   our agreements with people to people, which are currently scheduled to expire in 2020, give us the exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for kindergarten through high school students using the people to people name, and the non-exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for professionals, college students and athletes using the people to people name. our agreements with people to people, however, allow people to people to continue to conduct college and professional seminars and internship programs and to develop other sports and professional programs. we believe that we derive benefit from our ability to market our programs using the people to people name. if our agreement with people to people were terminated or if we were unable to use the branded name to market new programs or destinations, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire participants for our programs and consequently effect our results of operations. similarly, if our relationship with people to people is disrupted or is adversely impacted because people to people experiences interruption, delay or ceases operations in the future for any reason, our business could be harmed and our stock price may decline. our agreement with discovery education, which is currently scheduled to expire in 2014, gives us the exclusive right to license all-inclusive programs for kindergarten through high school students using the discovery education marks and the name “discovery student adventures.” this program is in its incubation period and as such the benefits currently derived from this agreement are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonality of our business and unexpected fluctuation in our revenues and results of operations from quarter to quarter may cause our stock price to decline. our business is highly seasonal. the majority of our travel programs are scheduled in june and july of each year, mildly complemented by travel for citizen ambassador programs and leadership ambassador programs throughout the entire year as well as the majority of content sales that occur primarily from september to june. we anticipate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. our operating income is substantially generated in the second and third quarters, which historically has offset the operating losses incurred during the rest of the year. annual results would be adversely affected if our revenues were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of the year. as a result of the foregoing, annual or quarterly operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. in such event, the price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. the market price of our common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations due to specific market changes such as:     • speculation in the press or investment community;   • actions by institutional shareholders;   • general market conditions, and   • limited shares of common stock available for trading. competition in the travel and education industries could impact our results of operations. the travel industry in general and the educational segment of the travel industry are highly competitive and have relatively low barriers to entry. we compete with other companies that provide similar educational travel programs for students and athletes, as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers and coaches with the assistance of local travel agents. people to people, under the terms of its agreement with us, reserves the right to offer programs to college students for studies abroad and to grant to other individuals or entities, the right to use the people to people name in connection with people to people’s professional education and sports programs. some of our competitors are larger and have greater brand-name recognition and financial resources than we do. in addition to competition we face in the travel industry, we also face significant competition from a wide variety of content and media web properties with companies throughout the world. content and advertising on the internet are intensely competitive and have been rapidly evolving with converging technologies. we compete with many larger web properties that have larger staff and more traffic to offer potential advertisers. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, and the failure to compete successfully may have a significant adverse effect on our ability for future growth as well as current, results of operations and future cash flows. litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs, judgments, fines and penalties that may not be covered by or may be in excess of available insurance coverage, may divert management’s attention and resources from our business and may result in adverse publicity.   -11- table of contents   due to the nature of our business and being a publicly held company, we may be subject to liability claims arising out of perceived wrong doing related to management’s decisions, securities claims, governmental investigations, business operations, accidents or disasters causing injury to delegates on our programs, including claims for serious personal injury or death. we believe that we have adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of our business. however, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss. further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future. successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims, or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. in addition to impact on profitability, liability claims asserted against us may also divert management’s attention and resources from our business to participation in the litigation process and defense of these asserted claims. lastly, claims asserted against us could adversely affect the public’s perception of us. see note 10, “commitments and contingencies,” to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for a description of the recent claims that have been made against us.        we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel. our performance is dependent on the continued services and performances of our senior management and certain other key personnel. the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have an adverse effect on our business operations, along with our ability to grow our business, generate innovative ideas, remain strategic, and recruit highly functional teams. our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. the failure to retain and attract necessary managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.   we are exposed to impairment risk of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.   financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company’s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate, and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization. during times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend. while we have not previously recorded any impairment losses for goodwill or intangible assets, continued adverse market conditions could impact the fair value of our reporting units that could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets.   the assessment for possible impairment requires us to make judgments, including: ·   estimated future cash flows, which are dependent upon internal forecasts; ·   estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, and ·   the useful life over which our cash flows will occur. changes in our estimates and assumptions as they relate to valuation of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets could affect, potentially materially, our financial condition or results of operations in the future. government regulation and taxation may adversely affect the travel industry and thus increase our operating expenses. many travel suppliers, particularly airlines, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign governments. in addition, the travel industry is subject to certain seller of travel laws and special taxes by federal, state, local and foreign governments, including but not limited to hotel bed taxes, car rental taxes, airline excise taxes, airport taxes and fees and income and business taxes. new or different regulatory schemes, increasing regulatory scrutiny on third party marketing and licensing arrangements, or changes in tax policy could have an adverse impact on the travel industry in general and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   -12- table of contents   if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights. substantially all of our publications in the bookrags segment are protected by copyright, held either in our name, in the name of the author of the work, or in the name of the sponsoring professional society. such copyrights protect our exclusive right to publish the work in the united states and in many countries abroad for specified periods. our ability to obtain and continue to obtain access to existing and new content, as well as our ability to continue to achieve expected results depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. our results may be adversely affected by lack of adequate legal or technological protections for our intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets that we operate in. we are exposed to concentration of credit risk that could affect our results of operations. cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions. at times, such balances may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit or may be on deposit at institutions which are not covered by this insurance. if such institutions were to become insolvent while holding our cash, cash equivalents or available-for-sale securities in excess of the insurance limit, we could suffer losses or it could be necessary to obtain credit financing to operate our travel programs. there is no assurance that we could respond timely enough to avoid losses and a material change in these markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. our payment card processing services are subject to compliance with the extensive rules and regulations under the payment card industry (pci) data security standard, and failure to comply with the applicable standards may subject us to substantial fines and penalties.   a significant portion of our sales are made with payment cards. we are subject to quarterly network security scans to ensure that we are protecting confidential customer information and bank card data in accordance with the applicable pci standards, and continuing compliance with such standards may require us to devote substantial time and incur additional costs to ensure we maintain our ability to process payment card transactions. additionally, in the event that the card associations or our sponsoring bank determine that the manner in which we process payment card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations, or if the card associations adopt new rules or regulations, we may be subject to substantial penalties and fines or forced to modify the manner in which we process payment card transactions, which may increase our overall costs. failure to maintain the security of internal or customer data could adversely affect us. our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers, that are processed, summarized and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers. we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. the integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to us. our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. a theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant remedial and other costs, fines and litigation.   -13- table of contents item 1b.           unresolved
