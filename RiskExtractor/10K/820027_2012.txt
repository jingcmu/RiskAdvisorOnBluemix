item 1a. risk factors. our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. we believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know. however, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. 23          table of contents risks relating to our business our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors. our financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors. many such factors of a global or localized nature include: political, social, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit; inflation; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; terrorism and armed conflicts; and natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact the results of our banking business and savings levels in all of our businesses. these factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. declines and volatility in u.s. and global market conditions have impacted our businesses in the past and may continue to do so. our businesses have been and in the future may be adversely affected by u.s. and global capital market and credit crises, the repricing of credit risk, equity market volatility and decline and stress or recession in the u.s. and global economies generally. each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. it is difficult to predict how long and to what extent the aforementioned conditions may exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will be directly affected in terms of revenues, management fees and investment valuations and earnings, and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions. as a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations. certain of our insurance and annuity products and certain of our investment and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and future impacts associated with such variations may differ from our historical costs. in addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products. although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations, significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. during periods of increasing market interest rates, we offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as fixed universal life insurance, fixed annuities, face-amount certificates and certificates of deposit, and we increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive. because returns on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. in addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies, annuity contracts and certificates of deposit and requests for policy loans, as policyholders, contractholders and depositors seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. this process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from our business. also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. these withdrawals and surrenders may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. an increase in surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings. during periods of falling interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, our spread may be reduced or could become negative, primarily because some of our products have guaranteed minimum crediting rates. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as long-term care and fixed universal life with secondary guarantees as well as fixed annuities and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in or stagnancy of low long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. in addition, reduced or negative spreads may require us to accelerate amortization of dac, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings. interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. during periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. in addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments.          24 table of contents significant downturns and volatility in equity markets may have, and have in the past had, an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. market downturns and volatility may cause, and have caused, potential new purchasers of our products to refrain from purchasing products, such as mutual funds, oeics, variable annuities and variable universal life insurance, which have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets. if we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility, our sales and management fee revenues could decline. downturns may also cause current shareholders in our mutual funds and oeics, contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products to withdraw cash values from those products. additionally, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have, and have had, an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, wrap accounts and variable annuity contracts. because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. in addition, some of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits. a significant equity market decline or volatility in equity markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. further, the cost of hedging our liability for these guarantees has increased as a result of low interest rates and volatility in the equity markets. in addition, heightened volatility creates greater uncertainty for future hedging effectiveness. we believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses. poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the columbia management family of mutual funds that are terminable on 60 days' notice. in addition, although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks, institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences, changes in our (or our financial advisors') reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. a reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business. moreover, if our money market funds experience a decline in market value, we may choose to contribute capital to those funds without consideration, which would result in a loss. in addition, during periods of unfavorable or stagnating market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our retail businesses. concerns about current market and economic conditions, declining real estate values and decreased consumer confidence have caused, and in the future may cause, some of our clients to reduce the amount of business they do with us. fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed maturity or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our asset management, advice & wealth management and annuities businesses. also, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, unemployment rates can increase, and have increased, which can result in higher loan delinquency and default rates, and this can have a negative impact on our banking business. uncertain economic conditions and heightened market volatility may also increase the likelihood that clients or regulators present or threaten legal claims, that regulators may increase the frequency and scope of their examinations of us or the financial services industry generally, and that lawmakers may enact new requirements or taxation which can have a material impact on our revenues, expenses or statutory capital requirements. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital. the capital and credit markets may experience, and have experienced, varying degrees of volatility and disruption. in some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest expenses and dividends on our capital stock. without sufficient liquidity, we could be required to curtail our operations and our business would suffer. we believe the level of cash and securities we maintain when combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term benefit and expense payment obligations. in the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may access financing sources such as bank debt. the availability of additional financing would depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of 25          table of contents credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that our shareholders, customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating organizations take actions against us. disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. such market conditions may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. the impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurers, reinsurers and other investment funds and other institutions. the operations of u.s. and global financial services institutions are highly interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults, limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses. many transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it. we also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions (including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits), reinsurance and underwriting arrangements and equity investments. there can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. downgrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom we transact could create the perception that our financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. additionally, we could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade of other financial institutions. accordingly, ratings downgrades for other financial institutions could affect our market capitalization and could limit access to or increase our cost of capital. the failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds. our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. in the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and subsequent uncertainty and volatility in the u.s. economy and financial markets have weakened the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receiverships, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments. third party defaults, bankruptcy filings, legal actions and other events may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients' access to cash and investments. capital and credit market volatility can exacerbate, and has exacerbated, the risk of third party defaults, bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients' access to cash and investments. although we are not required to do so, we have elected in the past, and we may elect in the future, to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events, provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage, or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage. any such election to provide support may arise from factors specific to our clients, our products or industry-wide factors. if we elect to provide additional support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. these losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. if we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital. changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry, both domestically and internationally, could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. in july 2010, the dodd-frank act was enacted into law. the dodd-frank act calls for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants,          26 table of contents reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading, enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures, and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors. certain elements of the dodd-frank act became effective immediately, though the details of many provisions are subject to additional studies and will not be known until regulatory agencies adopt final rules. the impact of the dodd-frank act on our company, the financial industry and the economy cannot be known until the rules and regulations called for under the act have been finalized, and, in some cases, implemented over time. accordingly, while certain elements of these reforms have yet to be finalized and implemented, the act has impacted and is expected to further impact the manner in which we market our products and services, manage our company and its operations and interact with regulators, all of which could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. certain provisions of the dodd-frank act that may impact our business include but are not limited to restrictions on proprietary trading and investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds, the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers, the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies, the resolution authority granted to the fdic, changes in regulatory oversight and greater oversight over derivatives instruments and trading. we will need to respond to changes to the framework for the supervision of u.s. financial institutions, including the creation of the financial stability oversight council ("fsoc") and the transition to the frb as our consolidated regulator and the occ as the primary regulator of ameriprise bank. for example, if we were to be designated by the fsoc as a systemically important financial institution, we may become subject to additional regulatory oversight and enhanced prudential standards, including those related to capital requirements and risk management standards at the parent company level. to the extent the dodd-frank act impacts the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us. it is uncertain whether the dodd-frank act, the rules and regulations developed thereunder, or any future legislation designed to stabilize the financial markets, the economy generally, or provide better protections to consumers, will have the desired effect. any new domestic or international legislation or regulatory changes could require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations, regulatory reporting relationships, results of operations or financial condition. consequences may include substantially higher compliance costs as well as material effects on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially impact our investments, results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. in addition, prolonged government support for, and intervention in the management of, private institutions could distort customary and expected commercial behavior on the part of those institutions, adversely impacting us. our businesses are regulated heavily, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition. virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. for a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k  "business  regulation." compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. any changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. such changes may impact our operations and profitability and the practices of our financial advisors, including with respect to the scope of products and services provided, the manner in which products and services are marketed and sold and the incurrence of additional costs of doing business. the recent economic crisis has resulted in numerous changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry, the full impact of which has yet to be realized. any incremental requirements, costs and risks imposed on us in connection with such current or future legislative or regulatory changes, may constrain our ability to market our products and services to potential customers, and could negatively impact our profitability and make it more difficult for us to pursue our growth strategy. certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below. the dodd-frank act mandates numerous changes to both the regulatory framework in which financial services companies operate and the specific regulations with which such companies must comply. amongst the changes to the regulatory framework are the abolishment of the ots and the transition of its responsibilities to other federal agencies. as a result, the occ became the primary regulator of ameriprise bank and the frb became the primary regulator of our parent company. we cannot predict how the transition to these new regulatory agencies, or the environment for supervisory expectations or enforcement actions, will impact us. some of the changes resulting from rules and regulations called for under the dodd-frank act could present operational challenges and increase costs. for example, in the area of derivatives, higher margin and capital requirements, coupled with more restrictive collateral rules, could impact our ability to effectively manage and hedge risk. ultimately these 27          table of contents complexities and increased costs could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative insurance products to our clients. similarly, the rules governing the capital requirements of financial institutions, both domestic and international, could have an adverse impact on our ability to allocate capital for strategic business purposes, while increasing costs for consumers of financial services. any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues and earnings. in the years ended december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we earned $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in distribution fees. our own columbia management family of mutual funds paid a significant portion of these revenues to us in accordance with plans and agreements of distribution adopted under rule 12b-1 promulgated under the investment company act. we believe that these fees are a critical element in the distribution of our own mutual funds. in july 2010, the sec proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to repeal rule 12b-1. the proposed changes have been subject to a public comment period and, following any enactment, would be phased in over a number of years. any industry-wide reduction or restructuring of rule 12b-1 fees could have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our own mutual funds and the fees we receive for distributing other companies' mutual funds, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. we expect that the department of labor will reissue proposed regulations in 2012 seeking to change the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under erisa and how such advice can be provided, which applies to both 401(k) plans and iras. these proposed regulations will again be subject to a public comment period upon their release. we cannot predict whether or when the regulations may be finalized, or how any final regulations may differ from the previously proposed regulations. if the regulations were to be issued substantially similar to previous drafts, they could impact how we receive fees, as well as how we compensate our advisors and design our investments and services for qualified accounts, which could negatively impact our results of operations. in october 2011, the frb, occ, fdic and sec jointly issued a proposed rule that would implement section 619 of the dodd-frank act (the "volcker rule") which contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of banking entities and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to have certain interests in, or relationships with, a wide variety of investment funds, including but not limited to hedge funds, foreign funds and private equity funds. this proposed rule would significantly impede our ability to launch investment products, including our ability to provide seed capital to us-based and foreign investment funds. we and our subsidiaries would also be prohibited from trading for our own accounts unless such trading qualifies for one of a limited number of exceptions. additionally, the proposed rule to implement the volcker rule has created considerable debate regarding the potential adverse liquidity impact within the financial markets, especially with respect to the trading of non-government fixed income securities. to the extent that liquidity in the financial markets is adversely impacted, we and our clients may experience increased costs and volatility with respect to our business operations and earnings. significant time and expense will be required to ensure that necessary compliance policies and procedures are implemented and to establish appropriate oversight. the proposed rule could also place u.s. asset managers at a competitive disadvantage in foreign markets. depending on final parameters of the volcker rule, including the breadth of the permitted activities under the volcker rule and the nature of the investment funds covered by the prohibitions and limitations under the volcker rule, the full impact of the rule on our operations, results and growth strategies cannot be known. our insurance companies are subject to state regulation and must comply with statutory reserve and capital requirements. state regulators continually review and update these requirements and other requirements relating to the business operations of insurance companies, including their underwriting and sales practices. the naic adopted a change to require principles-based reserves for variable annuities at the end of 2009, and continues to discuss moving to a principles-based reserving system for other insurance and annuity products. the requirement for principles-based variable annuity reserves, along with a similar risk-based capital requirement adopted previously, may result in statutory reserves and risk-based capital for variable annuities being more sensitive to changes in equity prices and other market factors. it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impact of future changes in statutory reserve and capital requirements on our insurance businesses. further, we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation, such as the option of federally chartered insurers or a mandated federal systemic risk regulator, may have on our insurance businesses or competitors. the majority of our affiliated advisors are independent contractors. legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in and the adoption of accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements. we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. from time to time, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), the sec and other regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. these changes are difficult          28 table of contents to predict, and it is possible that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. defaults in our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit products could adversely affect our earnings. issuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. as of december 31, 2011, 5% of our invested assets had ratings below investment-grade. moreover, economic downturns and corporate malfeasance can increase the number of companies, including those with investment-grade ratings that default on their debt obligations. default-related declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit products could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions. higher delinquency and default rates in our bank's customer loan portfolio could require us to contribute capital to ameriprise bank and may result in additional restrictions from our regulators that impact the use and access to that capital. if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we use reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances as described in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k  "business  our segments  protection  reinsurance." reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers. a reinsurer's insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, we use a variety of derivative instruments (including options, forwards, and interest rate and currency swaps) with a number of counterparties to hedge business risks. the amount and breadth of exposure to derivative counterparties, as well as the cost of derivative instruments, have increased significantly in connection with our strategies to hedge guaranteed benefit obligations under our variable annuity products. if our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments in a timely manner, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. that failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. this risk of failure of our hedge transactions from counterparty default may be increased by capital market volatility. the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments is subject to management's evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management's case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value that considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer, and management uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential, which assumptions and estimates are more difficult to make with certainty under current market conditions. our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. fixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. the determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on: (i) valuation methodologies; (ii) securities we deem to be comparable; and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and quoted market prices of comparable securities. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 29          table of contents during periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, the valuation of certain securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment. as such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. some of our investments are relatively illiquid. we invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests, collateralized debt obligations and restricted investments held by securitization trusts, among others, all of which are relatively illiquid. these asset classes represented 13% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2011. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. intense competition and the economics of changes in our product revenue mix and distribution channels could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability. our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments. we compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ability and credit ratings. our competitors include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial institutions. many of our businesses face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products, have greater financial resources, or have higher claims-paying ability or credit ratings than we do. some of our competitors may possess or acquire intellectual property rights that could provide a competitive advantage to them in certain markets or for certain products, which could make it difficult for us to introduce new products and services. some of our competitors' proprietary products or technology could be similar to our own, and this could result in disputes that could impact our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. this convergence could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. historically, our affiliated advisor network (both franchise advisors and those employed by afsi) provided annuity and insurance products issued almost exclusively (in the case of annuities) or predominantly (in the case of protection products) by our riversource life companies. in 2010, we expanded the offerings available to all of our affiliated advisors to include variable annuities issued by a limited number of unaffiliated insurance companies. as a result of this and further openings of our affiliated advisor network to the products of other companies, we could experience lower sales of our companies' products, higher surrenders, or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations. in late 2010, we discontinued the distribution of riversource variable annuities through third-party channels. this could impact the persistency of business sold previously through these channels, possibly resulting in the acceleration of dac amortization or other adverse effects on our results of operations. a drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services. strong investment performance helps to ensure the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates new sales of products and services. it may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as morningstar or lipper, which may further exacerbate the foregoing effects. strong investment performance and its effects are important elements to our stated goals of growing assets under management and achieving economies of scale. there can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns. any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of institutional asset management relationships. these impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. poor investment performance could also adversely affect our          30 table of contents ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. further, any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our affiliated advisors may further reduce profits as sales of other companies' mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds. we may not be able to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels or the terms by which unaffiliated third parties sell our products. we distribute certain of our investment products and fixed annuities through unaffiliated third-party advisors and financial institutions. maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy, as strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and to increase our assets under management, revenues and profitability. there can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue, as our distribution partners may cease to operate or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. any such reduction in access to third-party distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our asset management and annuities segments. access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory and annuities industries. relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the number of our products marketed. any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or number of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability. we face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent. our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified people. we are dependent on our network of affiliated advisors for a significant portion of the sales of our mutual funds, annuities, face-amount certificates, banking and insurance products. the market for these financial advisors is extremely competitive, as are the markets for qualified and skilled portfolio managers, investment managers, executives and marketing, finance, legal, compliance and other professionals. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. we face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures. we have made acquisitions and divestitures in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entities, unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. risks in divestiture transactions include difficulties in the separation of the disposed business, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to us and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the disposed business. these risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. a failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses. our reputation is one of our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and affiliated advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company. damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees, affiliated advisors and counterparties. negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and affiliated advisors. adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. our reputation is also dependent on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest. as we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we increasingly have to identify and address potential conflicts of interest, including those relating to our proprietary activities and those relating to our sales of non-proprietary products from manufacturers that have agreed to provide us marketing, sales and account maintenance support. for example, conflicts may arise between our position as a provider of financial planning services and as a manufacturer and/or distributor or broker of asset accumulation, income or insurance products that one of our affiliated advisors may recommend to a financial planning client. we have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest. however, identifying and appropriately addressing conflicts of interest is complex, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately. 31          table of contents in addition, the sec and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. it is possible also that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur, and will adversely affect our businesses. misconduct by our employees and affiliated advisors is difficult to detect and deter and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. misconduct by our employees and affiliated advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. misconduct can occur in each of our businesses and could include: binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits; hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses; improperly using, disclosing or otherwise compromising confidential information; recommending transactions that are not suitable; engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity; engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of customers; or otherwise not complying with laws, regulations or our control procedures. we cannot always deter misconduct by our employees and affiliated advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. preventing and detecting misconduct among our franchisee advisors who are not employees of our company present additional challenges. we cannot also assure that misconduct by our employees and affiliated advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses. we are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or affiliated advisors, are improper. pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the industries and businesses in which we operate. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. see item 3 of this annual report on form 10-k  "legal proceedings." in or as a result of turbulent times such as those we have experienced, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings generally increase. substantial legal liability in current or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. financial strength ratings, which various ratings organizations publish as a measure of an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintain public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and investment products; adversely affecting our relationships with our affiliated advisors and third-party distributors of our products; materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance. a downgrade in our credit ratings could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, including our competitors in the insurance industry, the ratings organizations have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions and have requested additional information from the companies that they rate. they may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the ratings organizations' models for maintenance of ratings levels, or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes of securities or types of institutions. ratings organizations may also become subject to tighter laws and regulations governing ratings, which may in turn impact ratings assigned to financial institutions. we cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which could adversely affect our business. as with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the ratings organizations.          32 table of contents if our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for our bank lending portfolio or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. we also establish reserves as estimates of the potential for loan losses in our consumer lending portfolios. reserves do not represent an exact calculation but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits or loan losses and related expenses we expect to incur over time. the assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. we cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. we monitor our reserve levels continually. if we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits or loan collections, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for more information on how we set our reserves, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. morbidity rates or mortality rates that differ significantly from our pricing expectations could negatively affect profitability. we set prices for riversource life insurance and some annuity products based upon expected claim payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, the morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness, and mortality rates, or likelihood of death. the long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. for example, if morbidity rates are higher, or mortality rates are lower, than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under disability income insurance policies, chronic care riders and immediate annuity contracts than we had projected. the same holds true for long term care policies we previously underwrote to the extent of the risks that we retained. if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected. the risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our long term care insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. as with life insurance, long term care insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years. however, as a relatively new product in the market, long term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance and, as a result, our ability to forecast future claim rates for long term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance. we have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring long term care policies we previously underwrote and by limiting our present long term care insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases on certain in force policies as described in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k  "business  our segments  protection  riversource insurance products  long term care insurance." we may be required to implement additional rate increases in the future and may or may not receive regulatory approval for the full extent and timing of any rate increases that we may seek. we may face losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts. the prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. given the ongoing economic and market dislocations, future consumer persistency behaviors could vary materially from the past. the effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. for most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. for our long term care insurance and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees, as well as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. some of our long term care insurance policies have experienced higher persistency and poorer loss experience than we had assumed, which led us to increase premium rates on certain policies. because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory 33          table of contents approval, which may not be forthcoming. moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily long term care insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability. dac represent the costs of acquiring new business, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and underwriting costs that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, life and disability income insurance and, to a lesser extent, marketing and promotional expenses for personal auto and home insurance, and distribution expense for certain mutual fund products. for annuity and universal life products, dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period. for certain mutual fund products, we generally amortize dac over fixed periods on a straight-line basis, adjusted for redemptions. our projections underlying the amortization of dac require the use of certain assumptions, including interest margins, mortality rates, persistency rates, maintenance expense levels and customer asset value growth rates for variable products. we periodically review and, where appropriate, adjust our assumptions. when we change our assumptions, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves. for more information regarding dac, see part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  recent accounting pronouncements." the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires, severe winter weather, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, insurrections and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities, preventing our employees and financial advisors from performing their roles or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims, as described below. such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our customers, business counterparties and regulators, as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets. the effects of natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following: a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies; significant property damage may materially increase the amount of claims submitted under our property casualty insurance policies; an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries; and declines and volatility in the financial markets may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration, which would harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees. we cannot predict the timing and frequency with which natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes may occur, nor can we predict the impact that changing climate conditions may have on the frequency and severity of natural disasters. as such, we cannot be sure that our actions to identify and mitigate the risks associated with such disasters and catastrophes, including predictive modeling, establishing liabilities for expected claims, acquiring insurance and reinsurance and developing business continuity plans, will be effective. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon such other party's intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could otherwise limit our ability to          34 table of contents offer certain product features. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. breaches of security or interference with our technology infrastructure could harm our business. our business is reliant upon technology systems and networks, including systems and networks managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store information and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions with clients, affiliated advisors, vendors and other third parties. we are also subject to certain federal and state regulations that require us to establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to protect sensitive client information. maintaining the integrity of our systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of affiliated advisors and clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients' personal information. accordingly, any breaches or interference with such systems and networks by third parties or by our advisors or employees may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. we have implemented security measures designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties, including hackers, and from employee or advisor error or malfeasance. we also require third party vendors, who in the provision of services to us are provided with or process information pertaining to our business or our clients, to meet certain information security standards. despite these measures, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our clients' personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or affiliated advisors or other damage to our business. in addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations. even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business. protection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business. if we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems, or other failure in operational execution, it could harm our business. system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our ability to develop, deliver or maintain our products and services, causing harm to our business and reputation and resulting in loss of affiliated advisors, clients or revenue. interruptions could be caused by operational failures arising from employee or advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, as well from our maintenance of existing technology. our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients. these interruptions can include fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, power losses, equipment failures, failures of internal or vendor software or systems and other events beyond our control. further, we face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. these risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products, such as those which incorporate automatic asset re-allocation, long/short trading strategies or multiple portfolios or funds, and business-driven hedging, compliance and other risk management strategies. any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk. risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct. we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so. nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. during periods of 35          table of contents market volatility or due to unforeseen events, the historically derived correlations upon which these methods are based may not be valid. as a result, these methods may not predict future exposures accurately, which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate. this could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and affiliated advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. these risks are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. we are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. as a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations. we act as a holding company for our subsidiaries, through which substantially all of our operations are conducted. dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our other financial obligations. these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our borrowings. if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. if any of this happens, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. insurance, banking and securities laws and regulations regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries (such as our insurance, banking and brokerage subsidiaries and our face-amount certificate company) to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. see item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k  "regulation" as well as the information contained in part ii, item 7 under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources." in addition to the various regulatory restrictions that constrain our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments to our company, the rating organizations impose various capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. the value of assets on the company-level balance sheets of our subsidiaries is a significant factor in determining these restrictions and capital requirements. as asset values decline, our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments can be reduced. additionally, the various asset classes held by our subsidiaries, and used in determining required capital levels, are weighted differently or are restricted as to the proportion in which they may be held depending upon their liquidity, credit risk and other factors. volatility in relative asset values among different asset classes can alter the proportion of our subsidiaries' holdings in those classes, which could increase required capital and constrain our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. the regulatory capital requirements and dividend-paying ability of our subsidiaries may also be affected by a change in the mix of products sold by such subsidiaries. for example, fixed annuities typically require more capital than variable annuities, and an increase in the proportion of fixed annuities sold in relation to variable annuities could increase the regulatory capital requirements of our life insurance subsidiaries. this may reduce the dividends or other permitted payments which could be made from those subsidiaries in the near term without the rating organizations viewing this negatively. further, the capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory scrutiny and intervention, which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. additionally, in the past we have found it necessary to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future. the provision of such support could adversely affect our excess capital, liquidity, and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries. the operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in non-u.s. denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income generated overseas. while we are a u.s.-based company, a portion of our business operations occur outside of the u.s. and some of our investments are not denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce u.s. dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. appreciation of the u.s. dollar could unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries. in comparison, depreciation of the          36 table of contents u.s. dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, though such depreciation could also diminish investor, creditor and rating organizations perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments. we may seek to mitigate these risks by employing various hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts. currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of u.s. dollar denominated investments that vary from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income or estate tax law could make some of our products less attractive to clients. many of the products we issue or on which our businesses are based (including both insurance products and non-insurance products) enjoy favorable treatment under current u.s. federal income or estate tax law. changes in u.s. federal income or estate tax law could thus make some of our products less attractive to clients. we are subject to tax contingencies that could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the u.s., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. these tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. in addition, changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes. risks relating to our common stock the market price of our shares may fluctuate. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: changes in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the financial services industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; our strategic moves and those of our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings; changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry and regulatory action; changes in and the adoption of accounting standards applicable to our businesses and the financial services industry; and changes in general economic or market conditions. stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include, among others: a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms, however, in 2010, our shareholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that provides for the annual election of all directors beginning at our 2013 annual meeting of shareholders; elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent; rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal. they are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. item 1b. unresolved
