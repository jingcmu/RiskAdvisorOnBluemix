item 1a. risk factors our future operating results could differ materially from the results described in this annual report on form 10-k due to the risks and uncertainties described below. we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements. see note regarding forward-looking statements on page 2 of this annual report on form 10-k. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below. risks related to our business if we incur operating losses for longer than we expect, or we are not able to raise additional capital, we may be unable to continue our operations, or we may become insolvent. from our inception through december 31, 2010, we have incurred net losses totaling $584.4 million. our net losses for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, were $21.9 million, $30.3 million, and $30.8 million, respectively. we expect to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue research and clinical development of our technologies, apply for regulatory approvals, and pursue partnering opportunities, commercialization, and related activities. furthermore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the success of our licensees and collaborative partners, as well as the likelihood and timing of new strategic licensing and partnering relationships and/or successful commercialization of oncophage and our various product candidates. if we incur operating losses for longer than we expect and/or we are unable to raise additional capital, we may become insolvent and be unable to continue our operations. on december 31, 2010, we had $19.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that, based on our current plans and activities, our working capital resources at december 31, 2010, combined with anticipated revenues, and the estimated proceeds from our license, supply, and collaborative agreements, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through 2011. we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds. for the year ended december 31, 2010, our average monthly cash used in operating activities was $1.2 million. we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures during 2011. we are required to maintain effective registration statements in connection with certain private placement agreements. if we are unable to keep the registration statements continuously effective in accordance with the terms of the private placement agreements, or do not maintain our listing on nasdaq or any electronic bulletin board, we are subject to liquidated damages penalties of up to a maximum of 10% of the aggregate purchase price paid by the original investors, or up to $3.8 million. since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes, interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, and debt provided through secured lines of credit. in order to finance future operations, we will be required to raise additional funds in the capital markets, through arrangements with collaborative partners, or from other sources. during february 2010, we entered into an at the market sales agreement with mcnicoll, lewis & vlak llc and wm smith & co (the sales agents) under which we may sell an aggregate of up to 20 million shares of our common stock from time to time through the sales agents. to date we have sold approximately 7.0 million shares of our common stock under this agreement for net proceeds, after expenses, of $8.8 million.   14 table of contents additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we will be required to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our development, commercialization and clinical trial programs. we also may be forced to license or sell technologies to others under agreements that allocate to third parties substantial portions of the potential value of these technologies. we may also be unable to continue our operations, or we may become insolvent. the weakness of the united states economy and the global economy may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition, particularly if our ability to raise additional funds is impaired. the ability of potential patients and/or health care payers to pay for our products could also be adversely impacted, thereby limiting our potential revenue. in addition, any negative impacts from any further deterioration in the credit markets and related financial crisis on our collaborative partners could limit potential revenue from our product candidates. we have significant debt, and we may not be able to make interest or principal payments when due. at the option of the holders, our 8% senior secured convertible notes due august 2014 (the 2006 notes) can be converted into an interest in one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that holds the rights or patents to qs-21 and herpv. if converted into an interest of this subsidiary, the ownership interest in the subsidiary will be determined by multiplying the quotient of the conversion amount divided by $25.0 million, by 30%. if the holders elect not to convert into the subsidiary, then at the maturity of the 2006 notes, we may elect to repay the then outstanding balance, $34.7 million at december 31, 2010, in cash or in common stock, subject to certain limitations. in no event will any of the note holders be obligated to accept equity that would result in them owning in excess of 9.99% of our outstanding common stock at any given time in connection with any conversion, redemption, or repayment of these notes. the 2006 notes are secured by the equity of the subsidiary that holds the rights or patents to qs-21 and herpv. our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including the factors identified in this risk factors section and other factors beyond our control. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness, we may be required, among other things, to:        seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;        refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;        sell, out-license, or otherwise dispose of assets; and/or        reduce or delay planned expenditures on research and development and/or commercialization activities. such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to make principal and interest payments. in addition, any such financing, refinancing, or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all. to date, we have had negative cash flows from operations. for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $14.8 million, $24.2 million, and $28.9 million, respectively. several factors could prevent the successful commercialization of oncophage in russia. in addition, we do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of oncophage in russia in the near term. in april 2008, the russian ministry of public health issued a registration certificate for the use of oncophage for the treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence and, in september 2008, the fda granted the necessary permission to allow for the export of oncophage from the united states to russia. the russian registration was our first product approval from a regulatory authority.   15 table of contents since approval, modest sales have occurred in russia. complexities unique to the logistics of this product may delay shipments and limit our ability to move commercial product in an efficient manner without incident. we currently do not have a business presence outside of the united states and rely on third parties to conduct our oncophage operations in russia. the reimbursement system in russia is changing rapidly and has experienced serious funding and administrative problems in its national and regional reimbursement programs. if we are unable to obtain local distribution arrangements including favorable pricing and payment terms, and/or develop appropriate logistical processes for distribution of oncophage, our commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. to date we have not been able to secure government reimbursement and there appears to be a limited private-pay market in russia. if we are unsuccessful in obtaining substantial reimbursement for oncophage from national or regional funds, we will have to rely on private-pay for the foreseeable future, which may limit or prevent our sales efforts because the ability and willingness of patients to pay is unclear and many patients will not be capable of paying for oncophage by themselves. because we have limited resources and minimal sales and marketing experience, successful commercialization of oncophage may not materialize. furthermore, we may experience significant delays in the receipt of payment for oncophage, or an inability to collect payments at all. if we fail to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our product candidates there may be no commercially viable market for these products, or the commercial potential of these products may be significantly limited. public and private insurance programs may determine that they will not cover our or our collaborative partners product candidates. in russia, europe, and other countries outside the united states, government-sponsored health care systems typically pay a substantial share of health care costs, and they may regulate reimbursement levels of products to control costs. if we or our collaborative partners are unsuccessful in obtaining substantial reimbursement for our product candidates from national or regional funds, we will have to rely on private-pay, which may delay or prevent our launch efforts, because the ability and willingness of patients to pay for our products is unclear. it is possible that there will be substantial delays in obtaining coverage of our product candidates, or the product candidates of our licensees or collaborative partners, if at all, and that, if coverage is obtained, there may be significant restrictions on the circumstances in which there would be reimbursement. we are unable to predict what impact any future regulation or third-party payer initiatives relating to reimbursement will have on our sales. if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in the countries in which we conduct our business, if these regulatory requirements change, or if we experience unanticipated regulatory problems, our commercial launch of our prophage series product candidates could be prevented or delayed, or our product candidates could be subjected to restrictions, or be withdrawn from the market, or some other action may be taken that may be adverse to our business. regulatory authorities generally approve products for particular indications. if an approval is for a limited indication, this limitation reduces the size of the potential market for that product. product approvals, once granted, are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by regulatory authorities. later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues and/or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications, complete withdrawal of a marketing application, and/or criminal prosecution. such regulatory enforcement could have a direct and negative impact on the product for which approval is granted, but also could have a negative impact on the approval of any pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications.   16 table of contents in addition, our operations and marketing practices are subject to regulation and scrutiny by the united states government, as well as governments of any other countries in which we do business or conduct activities. because we are a company operating in a highly regulated industry, regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us in connection with our business and marketing activities for various reasons. for example, our marketing and sales, labeling, and promotional activities in russia are subject to local regulations. if we fail to comply with regulations prohibiting the promotion of products for non-approved indications or products for which marketing approval has not been granted, regulatory authorities could bring enforcement actions against us that could inhibit our marketing capabilities, as well as result in penalties. in addition, the united states foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws, knowingly or unknowingly, could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, exclusion from government health care programs, imposition of significant fines, injunctions, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against us and/or our officers or employees. from time to time, new legislation is passed into law that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the fda and other global health authorities. additionally, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by health agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. it is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or whether regulations, guidance, or interpretations will change, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. we may not be able to make the prophage series of cancer vaccines available in countries other than russia or in indications other than renal cell carcinoma. the prophage series r-100 is currently only approved for marketing in russia as oncophage for the adjuvant treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence. the probability and timing of submissions and/or approval in any jurisdiction or indication for this product is uncertain. in 2008, we submitted a marketing authorization application (maa), to the european medicines agency (ema), requesting conditional authorization of oncophage in earlier-stage, localized kidney cancer. after its review, the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) of the ema adopted a negative opinion on our maa and subsequently we withdrew our application. if we continue to pursue a marketing authorization application for oncophage with the ema, there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the probability and timing of a favorable outcome. in addition, even if we continue this pursuit, oncophage may not achieve approval in europe because we may not successfully address issues associated with post-hoc analysis, subgroup analysis, lack of immunological data, product characterization, or other issues that may be of concern to the ema. the fda has indicated that our phase 3 clinical trials of prophage series r-100 (oncophage) and m-200 cannot, by themselves, support biologics license application (bla) filings in the studies indications (renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma). the signals and trends observed in the phase 3 renal cell carcinoma and melanoma trials are based on data analysis of subgroups of patients, some of which were not pre-specified. while the subgroup data might be suggestive of treatment effect, under current regulatory guidelines the results cannot be expected, alone, to support registration or approval in the united states, and our existing data may not support registration or approval in other territories outside of russia, including in europe. due to our lack of resources, our ability to perform additional studies may be limited. furthermore, studies may take years to complete and may fail to support regulatory filings for many reasons. in addition, our prophage series vaccines are a novel class of patient-specific (derived from the patients own tumor) oncology therapies, and the fda and foreign regulatory agencies, including the ema, which is responsible for product approvals in europe, and health   17 table of contents canada, which is responsible for product approvals in canada, have relatively little experience in reviewing these types of therapies. therefore, prophage series product candidates may experience a long regulatory review process and high development costs, either of which could delay or prevent our commercialization efforts. risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our business. the prophage series vaccine r-100 is currently only approved for sale in russia as oncophage. russia is an evolving market and regulatory, legal, and commercial structures are less predictable than in more mature markets. this unpredictability, as well as potential geopolitical instability in the russian region, could negatively impact the regulatory and/or commercial environment there, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, various other risks associated with foreign operations may impact our success. possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign and domestic currencies, disruptions in the import, export, and transportation of patient tumors and our product, the product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign relationships, the performance of our licensees or collaborators, and unexpected regulatory, economic, or political changes in foreign markets. our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily for the euro and the ruble. movement in foreign currency exchange rates could cause revenue or clinical trial costs to vary significantly in the future and may affect period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. historically, we have not hedged our exposure to these fluctuations in exchange rates. our commercial and international operations experience and resources are limited and need to be developed or acquired. if we fail to do so, our revenues may be limited or nonexistent. in addition, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to augment our existing capabilities. as we have limited experience with commercial and international operations, it may be difficult to accurately estimate our costs. we currently do not have employees, manufacturing, or business operations facilities outside of the united states and we will rely significantly on consultants, partners, and other third parties to conduct our sales, marketing, and distribution operations. if these third parties are unable to fulfill their obligations this could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts. if in the future we elect to perform sales, marketing, and distribution functions ourselves, we will face a number of additional risks, including the need to recruit experienced marketing and sales personnel, or incur significant expenditures. in addition, we may need to compete with other companies that have more experienced and better-funded operations. where we have licensed our products to third-party collaborators or licensees, we will be dependent on their commercial operations, sales and marketing expertise and resources, and any revenues we receive from those products will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others. our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources. our products and the products in development by our collaborative partners may fail because of intense competition from major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies engaged in the development of product candidates directed at cancer, infectious diseases and degenerative disorders. several of these companies have products that utilize technologies similar to our prophage series and/or patient-specific or other vaccine based techniques, such as dendreon and accentia, as well as immuncell-lc, ict-107, dc-vax and cdx-110, being developed by innocell corp, immunocellular therapeutics, northwest biotherapeutics and celldex, respectively, for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioma. there is no guarantee that we will be able to compete with potential future products being developed by our competitors. for example, oncophage may compete with therapies currently in development for non-metastatic   18 table of contents renal cell carcinoma, such as wilex ags rencarex (wx-g250), which is in phase 3 clinical trials. additionally, sorafenib and sunitinib, which are approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma, are being studied in non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and other products that have been developed for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as temsirolimus, bevacizumab and pazopanib, may also be developed for non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma. as our prophage series vaccines are potentially developed in other indications, they will face additional competition in those indications. in addition, for our prophage series vaccines, and all of our product candidates, prior to regulatory approval, we may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer therapies continue to accelerate. our patent to purified qs-21 expired in most territories in 2008. additional protection for our qs-21 proprietary adjuvant in combination with other agents is provided by our other patents. our license and manufacturing agreements for qs-21 typically provide royalties for at least 10 years after commercial launch independent of patent expiry. however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to collect royalties in the future. we are aware of compounds that claim to be identical to qs-21 that are being used in clinical trials. several other vaccine adjuvants are in development and could compete with qs-21 for inclusion in vaccines in development. these adjuvants include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, under development by pfizer, idera, juvaris, and dynavax, mf59 under development by novartis, ic31, under development by intercell, and mpl, under development by gsk. in addition, at least one company, csl limited, as well as academic institutions, are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. many of our competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have greater financial and human resources and more experience than we do. our competitors may:        commercialize their product candidates sooner than we commercialize our own;        develop safer or more effective therapeutic drugs or preventive vaccines and other therapeutic products;        implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing and capture some of our potential market share;        establish superior intellectual property positions;        discover technologies that may result in medical insights or breakthroughs, which render our drugs or vaccines obsolete, possibly before they generate any revenue; or        adversely affect our ability to recruit patients for our clinical trials. manufacturing problems may cause product launch delays, unanticipated costs, or loss of revenue streams. if the demand for our prophage series vaccines is substantially greater than we anticipate, our capacity may not be able to meet product demand. in addition, higher manufacturing loads may result in higher manufacturing failure rates as the operation becomes more complex. we currently manufacture our prophage series vaccines in our lexington, massachusetts facility and we intend to continue using this facility to satisfy all demands for product. while we believe we will be able to cover all demands in the near term, there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet all future or unanticipated increases in demand, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our business. such demand may also limit our ability to manufacture product in support of clinical trials, and this could cause a delay or failure in our prophage series programs. manufacturing of prophage series vaccines is complex, and various factors could cause delays or an inability to supply vaccine. deviations in the processes controlling manufacture could result in production failures.   19 table of contents we can also manufacture other clinical products in our own manufacturing facility. our manufacturing facility has support areas that it shares with the prophage series manufacturing areas. as we seek to make prophage series vaccines available in other territories, the applicable regulatory bodies may require us to make our manufacturing facility a single product facility. in such an instance, we would no longer have the ability to manufacture products such as herpv in our current facility. in order to prepare additional herpv to support future clinical trials, we would then have to manufacture or have manufactured this product in an appropriate alternative facility. currently, we do not manufacture qs-21 in our own manufacturing facility, and we have given two qs-21 licensees who have the most advanced qs-21 programs the right to manufacture qs-21 themselves or through third-party manufacturers. if these licensees are unable to successfully manufacture or have manufactured qs-21, the commercialization of the product candidates being developed by such licensees could be delayed or prevented, and we could lose important potential future revenue streams. we currently outsource the manufacture of qs-21 under an agreement that expires in 2012. if we are not able to renew this agreement we may have to identify an alternative manufacturing source or the investment of substantial funds would be required to develop our own manufacturing facility. we or our currently contracted suppliers may never have the ability to manufacture commercial grade qs-21. we currently rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon third parties, potentially including our collaborators or licensees, to produce materials required to support our product candidates, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and commercial efforts. a number of factors could cause production interruptions at our manufacturing facility or at our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including equipment malfunctions, labor or employment retention problems, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist activities, or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. alternatively, there is the possibility we may have excess manufacturing capacity if product candidates do not progress as planned. there are a limited number of contract manufacturers or suppliers that are capable of manufacturing our product candidates or the materials used in their manufacture. if we are unable to do so ourselves or to arrange for third-party manufacturing or supply of these product candidates or materials, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of these product candidates or commercialize them ourselves or through our collaborative partners or licensees. reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control, and the possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. manufacturing is also subject to extensive government regulation. regulatory authorities must approve the facilities in which human health care products are produced. in addition, facilities are subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing processes may require additional regulatory approvals, either of which could cause us to incur significant additional costs and lose revenue. the drug development and approval process is uncertain, time-consuming, and expensive. clinical development, including preclinical testing and the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. it also can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. we must provide regulatory authorities with manufacturing, product characterization, and preclinical and clinical data demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale. it may take us many years to complete our testing, and failure can occur at any stage of testing. interim results of preclinical studies or clinical trials do not necessarily predict their final results, and acceptable results in early studies might not be seen in later studies. any preclinical or clinical test may fail to produce results satisfactory to regulatory authorities for many reasons, including but not limited to insufficient product characterization, poor study structure conduct or statistical   20 table of contents analysis planning, failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients or failure to prospectively identify the most appropriate patient eligibility criteria, and collectability of data. preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial, adverse medical events during a clinical trial, or safety issues resulting from products of the same class of drug could require a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated or cause a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful. as of december 31, 2010, we have spent approximately 16 years and $281.9 million on our research and development program in heat shock proteins for cancer. the timing and success of a clinical trial is dependent on enrolling sufficient patients in a timely manner, avoiding serious or significant adverse patient reactions, and demonstrating efficacy of the product candidate in order to support a favorable risk versus benefit profile, among other considerations. the timing and success of our clinical trials, in particular, are also dependent on clinical sites and regulatory authorities accepting each trials protocol, statistical analysis plan, product characterization tests, and clinical data. in addition, regulatory authorities may request additional information or data that is not readily available. delays in our ability to respond to such requests would delay, and failure to adequately address concerns would prevent, our commercialization efforts. our existing oncophage data may not support registration or approval in territories outside of russia, including in the u.s. or europe. any additional studies may take years to complete and may fail to support regulatory filings for many reasons. in october 2008, we submitted a maa to the ema, requesting conditional authorization of oncophage in earlier-stage, localized kidney cancer. after its review the chmp of the ema adopted a negative opinion on this maa and subsequently we withdrew our application. we are currently evaluating our options to determine whether and how to proceed with oncophage in renal cell carcinoma. if we continue to pursue a maa for oncophage with the ema, there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the probability and timing of a favorable outcome. in addition, even if we continue this pursuit, oncophage may not achieve approval in europe. additionally, the fda has indicated that our phase 3 clinical trials of prophage series r-100 (oncophage) and m-200 cannot, by themselves, support bla filings in the studies indications (renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma). the signals and trends observed in these phase 3 renal cell carcinoma and melanoma trials are based on data analysis of subgroups of patients, some of which were not pre-specified. while the subgroup data might be suggestive of treatment effect, under current regulatory guidelines the results cannot be expected, alone, to support registration or approval in the united states. furthermore, regulatory authorities, including the fda and the ema, may have varying opinions of our product characterization, preclinical and clinical trial data for our other product candidates, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval or clearance. delays or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for our product candidates may:        adversely affect the marketing of any products we or our licensees or collaborators develop;        impose significant additional costs on us or our licensees or collaborators;        diminish any competitive advantages that we or our licensees or collaborators may attain;        limit our ability to receive royalties and generate revenue and profits; and        adversely affect our business prospects and ability to obtain financing. delays or failures in our receiving regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner may result in us having to incur additional development expense and subject us to having to secure additional financing. as a result, we will not be able to commercialize them in the timeframe anticipated, and our business will suffer.   21 table of contents new data from our research and development activities and/or resource considerations could modify our strategy and result in the need to adjust our projections of timelines and costs of programs. because we are focused on novel technologies, our research and development activities, including our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, involve the ongoing discovery of new facts and the generation of new data, based on which we determine next steps for a relevant program. these developments can occur with varying frequency and constitute the basis on which our business is conducted. we need to make determinations on an ongoing basis as to which of these facts or data will influence timelines and costs of programs. we may not always be able to make such judgments accurately, which may increase the costs we incur attempting to commercialize our product candidates. we monitor the likelihood of success of our initiatives and we may need to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be commercially feasible, due to our limited resources. we may need to successfully address a number of technological challenges in order to complete development of our product candidates. moreover, these product candidates may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approvals or prevent or limit commercial use. failure to enter into significant licensing, distribution and/or collaboration agreements may hinder our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates and will increase our need to rely on other financing mechanisms, such as sales of debt or equity securities, to fund our operations. we have been engaged in efforts to enter into licensing, distribution and/or collaborative agreements with one or more pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to assist us with development and/or commercialization of our product candidates. if we are successful in entering into such agreements, we may not be able to negotiate agreements with economic terms similar to those negotiated by other companies. we may not, for example, obtain significant upfront payments or substantial royalty rates. if we fail to enter into any such agreements, our efforts to develop and/or commercialize our products or product candidates may be undermined. in addition, if we do not raise funds through any such agreements, we will need to rely on other financing mechanisms, such as sales of debt or equity securities, to fund our operations. while we have been pursuing these business development efforts for several years, we have not entered into a substantial agreement relating to the potential development or commercialization of oncophage or any of the other prophage series vaccines. due to the announcements in march 2006 that part i of our phase 3 trial in renal cell carcinoma did not achieve its primary endpoint in the intent to treat population, and in november 2009 that the chmp adopted a negative opinion on our maa, and because companies may be skeptical regarding the potential success of a patient-specific product candidate, many companies may be unwilling to commit to an agreement prior to receipt of additional clinical data, if at all. in addition, we would consider license and/or co-development opportunities to advance herpv. this product is at an early stage and collaborative partners or licensees may defer discussions until results from early clinical trials become available, or they may not engage in such discussions at all. further clinical development of herpv will require a partner to support its advancement. because we rely on collaborators and licensees for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidate programs, these programs may not prove successful, and/or we may not receive significant payments from such parties. part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with academic and corporate collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. our success depends on our ability to negotiate such agreements and on the success of the other parties in performing research, preclinical and clinical testing, completing regulatory applications, and commercializing product candidates. for example, the development of prophage g series is currently dependent   22 table of contents in large part on the efforts of our institutional collaborators, such as the brain tumor research center at the university of california, san francisco, which is conducting phase 2 clinical trials of prophage series g-100 and g-200 for the treatment of glioma. in addition, substantially all product candidates containing qs-21 depend on the success of our collaborative partners or licensees, and the companys relationships with these third parties. such product candidates depend on the successful and adequate manufacture and/or supply of qs-21, and our collaborators and licensees successfully enrolling patients and completing clinical trials, being committed to dedicating the resources to advance these product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals, and successfully commercializing product candidates. these development activities may fail to produce marketable products due to unsuccessful results or abandonment of these programs, failure to enter into future collaborations or license agreements, or the inability to manufacture product supply requirements for our collaborators and licensees. for example, an undisclosed infectious disease phase 3 program has been discontinued by one of our collaborators, and in august 2006, pharmexa a/s announced a decision to cease dosing patients in their phase 2 clinical trial of their her-2 protein autovac breast cancer vaccine containing our qs-21 adjuvant, after it was determined that the trial was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint. several of our agreements also require us to transfer important rights and regulatory compliance responsibilities to our collaborators and licensees. as a result of collaborative agreements, we will not control the nature, timing, or cost of bringing these product candidates to market. our collaborators and licensees could choose not to devote resources to these arrangements or, under certain circumstances, may terminate these arrangements early. they may cease pursuing product candidates or elect to collaborate with different companies. in addition, these collaborators and licensees, outside of their arrangements with us, may develop technologies or products that are competitive with those that we are developing. from time to time, we may also become involved in disputes with our collaborators or licensees. such disputes could result in the incurrence of significant expense, or the termination of collaborations. we may be unable to fulfill all of our obligations to our collaborators, which may result in the termination of collaborations. as a result of these factors, our strategic collaborations may not yield revenue. furthermore, we may be unable to enter into new collaborations or enter into new collaborations on favorable terms. failure to generate significant revenue from collaborations would increase our need to fund our operations through sales of debt or equity securities and would negatively affect our business prospects. if we are unable to purify heat shock proteins we may have difficulty successfully initiating or completing our clinical trials, and, even if we do successfully complete our clinical trials, generating sizable market potential. depending on the type and stage of cancer and the patient population, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the prophage series vaccines for a particular cancer depends in part on our ability to purify heat shock proteins from that type of cancer. if we experience difficulties in purifying heat shock proteins for a sufficiently large number of patients in our clinical trials, we may face delays in enrolling sufficient patients and subsequently utilize more internal resources to satisfy enrolment requirements. manufacturing failures may also lower the probability of a successful analysis of the data from clinical trials and, ultimately, the ability to obtain regulatory approvals. we have successfully manufactured product across many different cancer types, however, the success rate per indication has varied. we have evolved our manufacturing processes to better accommodate a wider range of tumor types. our current manufacturing technologies have been successful in manufacturing product from approximately 92% of the rcc tumors received and approximately 90% of the tumors received for patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials in glioma. we expect to continue to devote resources to allow for a better evaluation of tumor characteristics and screening methods in an attempt to increase manufacturing success rates. we may encounter problems with other types of cancer or patients, such as pediatric patients, as we expand our research. if we cannot overcome these problems, the number of cancer types that our heat shock protein product candidates could treat would be limited. in addition, if we commercialize our heat shock protein product candidates, we may not be able to replicate past manufacturing success rates and we may face claims from patients for whom we are unable to produce a vaccine.   23 table of contents if we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights, competitors will be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products. if we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how, our competitors may use our inventions to develop competing products. we currently have exclusive rights to 73 issued united states patents and 117 issued foreign patents. we also have exclusive rights to 4 pending united states patent applications and 29 pending foreign patent applications. however, our patents may not protect us against our competitors. our patent positions, and those of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. the standards which the united states patent and trademark office uses to grant patents, and the standards which courts use to interpret patents, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. consequently, the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them, and they are challenged, is uncertain. in addition, the type and extent of patent claims that will be issued to us in the future is uncertain. any patents that are issued may not contain claims that permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology. furthermore, the product development timeline for biotechnology products is lengthy and it is possible that our issued patents covering our product candidates in the united states and other jurisdictions may expire prior to commercial launch. in addition, because our patent on qs-21 composition of matter has already expired in virtually all territories, we are limited to protecting certain combinations of qs-21 with other adjuvants or formulations of qs-21 with other agents, e.g., excipients that improve performance of the compound. however, there is no guarantee that a third party would necessarily choose to use qs-21 in combination with such adjuvants or formulate it with the excipients covered by our patents. we are aware of at least one other party that makes a synthetic version of qs-21, claimed by such party to be equivalent in activity to natural qs-21, and has also developed derivatives of qs-21 which have shown biological activity. in addition to our patented technology, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. we may not be able to effectively protect our rights to this technology or information. other parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. we generally require each of our employees, consultants, collaborators, and certain contractors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment, consulting, collaborative, or contractual relationship with us. however, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our technology or information, or in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies. we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights in, or to use, our technology. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights. if we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask a court to rule that our patents are invalid and should not be enforced against that third party. these lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of our patents. in addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the claimed inventions. there is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other partys activities do not infringe our patents. we may not have rights under some patents or patent applications related to some of our existing and proposed products or processes. third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad. therefore, in some cases, such as those described below, in order to develop, use,   24 table of contents manufacture, sell, or import some of our existing or proposed products, or develop or use some of our existing or proposed processes, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, licenses under third-party patents issued in the united states and abroad, or those that might issue from united states and foreign patent applications. in such an event, we likely would be required to pay license fees or royalties or both to the licensor. if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators may not be able to exploit these products or processes. furthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by such third-partys patents or other intellectual property rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities. these lawsuits are expensive. some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. there is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third-partys patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. in addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party substantial damages for having violated the other partys patents. the biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products. the coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. moreover, patent holders sometimes send communications to a number of companies in related fields suggesting possible infringement, and we, like a number of biotechnology companies, have received such communications in the past and may receive others in the future. if we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, which we may not be able to do. proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult, since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. if patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved against us, we or our licensees or collaborators may be enjoined from using, manufacturing, selling, or importing our products or processes without a license from the other party, and we may be held liable for significant damages. we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all. uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into collaborations with other entities, obtain financing, or compete in the marketplace. patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and other resources. if we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. we are a party to various license agreements under which we receive the right to practice and use important third-party patent rights and we may enter into additional licenses in the future. our existing licenses impose, and we expect future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance, and other obligations on us. if we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents. if we fail to retain the services of, and/or maintain positive relations with, key individuals and our employees, we may not be able to achieve our strategic and operational objectives. garo h. armen, ph.d., the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer, co-founded the company in 1994 with pramod k. srivastava, ph.d., and has been and continues to be integral to building our company and developing our technology. if dr. armen severed his relationship with agenus, our business may be adversely impacted. effective december 1, 2005, we entered into an employment agreement with dr. armen. subject to the earlier termination as provided in the agreement, the agreement had an original term of one year and is   25 table of contents automatically extended thereafter for successive terms of one year each, unless either party provides notice to the other at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the original or any extension term. dr. armen plays an important role in our day-to-day activities. we do not carry key employee insurance policies for dr. armen or any other employee. dr. srivastava currently has a consulting agreement with us pursuant to which he is retained to provide advice and services to agenus from time to time. this agreement has an initial term ending march 31, 2011. we also rely greatly on engaging and retaining other highly trained and experienced senior management and scientific and operations personnel and consultants. the competition for these and other qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. in order to reduce our expenses, we have eliminated certain employee benefits, restructured our business, and reduced staffing levels. this restructuring has eliminated any redundancy in skills and capabilities in key areas. if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic and operational objectives. we may face litigation that could result in substantial damages and may divert managements time and attention from our business. agenus, our chairman and chief executive officer, garo h. armen, ph.d., and two investment banking firms that served as underwriters in our initial public offering were named as defendants in a federal civil class action lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york. substantially similar actions were filed concerning the initial public offerings for more than 300 different issuers, and the cases were coordinated for pre-trial purposes as in re initial public offering securities litigation, 21 mc 92. the suit alleges that the brokerage arms of the investment banking firms charged secret excessive commissions to certain of their customers in return for allocations of our stock in the offering. the suit also alleges that shares of our stock were allocated to certain of the investment banking firms customers based upon agreements by such customers to purchase additional shares of our stock in the secondary market. the parties have reached a global settlement of the litigation. under the settlement, the insurers will pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to the defendants, and the defendants will bear no financial liability. agenus and the other defendants will receive complete dismissals from the case. in october 2009, the court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement, and subsequently judgment was entered. various objectors have filed appeals. if for any reason the settlement does not become effective, we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and intend to defend the action vigorously. we are unable to predict the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate our potential liability, if any. in addition, we may currently be, or may become involved in additional litigation. any such litigation could be expensive in terms of out-of-pocket costs and management time, and the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. our directors and officers insurance policies provide $30.0 million of coverage. this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us for future claims. product liability and other claims against us may reduce demand for our products and/or result in substantial damages. we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to testing our product candidates in human clinical trials and commercial sales of oncophage in russia, and may face even greater risks if we sell oncophage in other territories and/or sell our other product candidates commercially. an individual may bring a product liability claim against us if oncophage or one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. product liability claims may result in:        decreased demand for oncophage or our product candidates;        regulatory investigations;        injury to our reputation;   26 table of contents      withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;        costs of related litigation; and        substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs. we manufacture the prophage series vaccines from a patients cancer cells, and medical professionals must inject the vaccines into the same patient from which they were manufactured. a patient may sue us if a hospital, a shipping company, or we fail to deliver the removed cancer tissue or that patients prophage series vaccine. we anticipate that the logistics of shipping will become more complex if the number of patients we treat increases and that shipments of tumor and/or prophage series vaccines may be lost, delayed, or damaged. additionally, complexities unique to the logistics of commercial products may delay shipments and limit our ability to move commercial product in an efficient manner without incident. to date, we have obtained transportation insurance coverage for commercial oncophage being shipped to russia. we do not have any other insurance that covers loss of or damage to the prophage series vaccines or tumor material, and we do not know whether such insurance will be available to us at a reasonable price or at all. we have limited product liability coverage for use of our product candidates. our product liability policy provides $10.0 million aggregate coverage and $10.0 million per occurrence coverage. this limited insurance coverage may be insufficient to fully cover us for future claims. if we do not comply with environmental laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs and potential disruption to our business. we use hazardous, infectious, and radioactive materials, and recombinant dna in our operations, which have the potential of being harmful to human health and safety or the environment. we store these hazardous (flammable, corrosive, toxic), infectious, and radioactive materials, and various wastes resulting from their use, at our facilities pending use and ultimate disposal. we are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing use, generation, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials. we may incur significant costs complying with both current and future environmental health and safety laws and regulations. in particular, we are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration, the environmental protection agency, the drug enforcement agency, the department of transportation, the centers for disease control and prevention, the national institutes of health, the international air transportation association, and various state and local agencies. at any time, one or more of the aforementioned agencies could adopt regulations that may affect our operations. we are also subject to regulation under the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation development programs. although we believe that our current procedures and programs for handling, storage, and disposal of these materials comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidents involving contamination from these materials. although we have limited pollution liability coverage ($2.0 million) and a workers compensation liability policy, we could be held liable for resulting damages in the event of an accident or accidental release, and such damages could be substantially in excess of any available insurance coverage and could substantially disrupt our business. risks related to our common stock the unaffiliated holders of certain convertible securities have the right to convert such securities into a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. according to publicly filed documents, mr. brad m. kelley beneficially owns 5,546,240 shares of our outstanding common stock and 31,620 shares of our series a convertible preferred stock. the shares of preferred stock are currently convertible at any time into 2,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $15.81, are non-voting, and carry a 2.5% annual dividend yield. if mr. kelley had converted all of the shares of preferred stock on december 31, 2010, he would have held approximately 7% of our outstanding common stock. we currently have a right of first refusal agreement with mr. kelley that provides us with limited rights to purchase certain of mr. kelleys shares if he proposes to sell them to a third party.   27 table of contents mr. kelleys substantial ownership position provides him with the ability to substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. furthermore, collectively, mr. kelley and garo armen, our ceo, control approximately 11% of our outstanding common stock as of december 31, 2010, providing ability, if they vote in the same manner, to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a stockholder vote. if mr. kelley were to convert all of his preferred stock into common stock, the combined total would increase to 12%. additional purchases of our common stock by mr. kelley also would increase both his percentage of outstanding voting rights and the percentage combined with our ceo. while mr. kelleys shares of preferred stock do not carry voting rights, the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion carry the same voting rights as other shares of common stock. our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market, which could affect its market price and liquidity. our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol agen. in the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements, our common stock may be put under review or removed from the listing on the nasdaq capital market. on march 3, 2011, we were notified by the listing qualifications staff of nasdaq (the staff) indicating that we are not in compliance with the nasdaq marketplace rule 5550(a)(2) (the bid price requirement) because the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for 30 consecutive business days. in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule 5810(c)(3)(a), we have been provided 180 calendar days, or until august 30, 2011, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. if compliance is not demonstrated within the applicable compliance period, the staff will notify us that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market. however, we may appeal the staffs determination to delist our securities to a hearings panel. during any appeal process, shares of our common stock would continue to trade on the nasdaq capital market. there can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market or whether any appeal would be granted by the hearings panel. provisions in our organizational documents could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace our current management. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board and removal of directors only for cause. accordingly, stockholders may elect only a minority of our board at any annual meeting, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in management. in addition, under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock and determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. our issuance of additional preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby effect a change in the composition of our board of directors. our certificate of incorporation also provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent. our bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations and permit only our president or a majority of the board of directors to call a special stockholder meeting. these provisions may have the effect of preventing or hindering attempts by our stockholders to replace our current management. in addition, delaware law prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction. our board of directors may use this provision to prevent changes in our management. also, under applicable delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.   28 table of contents our stock has historically had low trading volume, and its public trading price has been volatile. between our initial public offering on february 4, 2000 and december 31, 2010, and for the year ended december 31, 2010, the closing price of our common stock has fluctuated between $0.30 and $52.63 per share and $0.60 and $1.38 per share, respectively. the average daily trading volume for the year ended december 31, 2010 was approximately 1,103,000 shares. the market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. in addition to general market volatility, many factors may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our stock, including:        continuing operating losses, which we expect over the next several years as we continue our development activities;        announcements of decisions made by public officials;        results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;        announcements of new collaboration agreements with strategic partners or developments by our existing collaborative partners;        announcements of technological innovations, new commercial products, failures of products, or progress toward commercialization by our competitors or peers;        developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent and litigation matters;        publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to product candidates under development; and        quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. the sale of a significant number of shares could cause the market price of our stock to decline. the sale by us or the resale by stockholders of a significant number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. as of december 31, 2010, we had approximately 111,625,000 shares of common stock outstanding. all of these shares are eligible for sale on the nasdaq capital market, although certain of the shares are subject to sales volume and other limitations. we have filed registration statements to permit the sale of approximately 25,437,000 shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan and certain equity plans that we assumed in our acquisitions of aquila biopharmaceuticals, inc. and aronex pharmaceuticals, inc. we have also filed registration statements to permit the sale of 1,000,000 shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, to permit the sale of 450,000 shares of common stock under our directors deferred compensation plan, to permit the sale of 49,643,966 shares of common stock pursuant to various private placement agreements. as of december 31, 2010, an aggregate of 39.3 million shares remain available for sale under these registration statements. the market price of our common stock may decrease based on the expectation of such sales. as of december 31, 2010, options to purchase 7,272,850 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price per share of $2.24 were outstanding. many of these options are subject to vesting that generally occurs over a period of up to four years following the date of grant. as of december 31, 2010, we have 513,449 nonvested shares outstanding. because we are a small public company we believe we have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations which have increased our costs in the past and have required additional management resources. the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and rules adopted by the sec and the nasdaq have resulted in significant costs to us. in particular, our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations regarding the required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, and our   29 table of contents independent registered public accounting firms audit of internal control over financial reporting, have required commitments of significant management time. we expect these commitments to continue. additionally, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors, particularly independent directors, or qualified executive officers. our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15 of the securities exchange act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all deficiencies or weaknesses in our financial reporting. while our management has concluded that there were no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2010, our procedures are subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or as a result of a deterioration in compliance with such procedures. no assurance is given that our procedures and processes for detecting weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will be effective.   item 1b. unresolved
