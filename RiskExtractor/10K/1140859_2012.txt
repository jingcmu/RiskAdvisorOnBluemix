item 1a.    risk factors          the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report.      intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins.          the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive. we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals, cardinal and mckesson; regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals; national generic distributors; chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals; manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers; specialty distributors; and packaging and healthcare technology companies (see "competition"). competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services, where gross margins historically have been higher than in abdc. reflecting that increased competition, our two national competitors have continued to expand their footprint in the area of specialty distribution and services. if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms, our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected. in addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers, it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services.      our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices.          certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation-based compensation component to them. arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflation-based. less than 10% of our gross profit from brand-name manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases. if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price increases slows, our results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price deflation. if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.      declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business. deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.      our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption.          in recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption. if the markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit generally, and on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.      our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer.          in fiscal 2012, our largest customer, medco, was acquired by express scripts. medco accounted for 17% of our revenue in fiscal 2012. we recently signed a three year agreement, effective october 1, 2012, to supply primarily brand-name pharmaceuticals to express scripts. our top ten customers represented approximately 41% of fiscal 2012 revenue. we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations ("gpos"), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members, who are hospitals, pharmacies or other healthcare providers. approximately 11% of our revenue in fiscal 2012 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships. we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. 7 table of contents      our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer.          most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. at september 30, 2012, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 10% and 5% of accounts receivable, net.      our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier.          our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.      increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability.          the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and security standards of the dea, the fda, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies.          in recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations, including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees, that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution. for example, florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in july 2016. in order to comply with the florida requirements, we implemented an e-pedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays.          at the federal level, final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006. the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs and/or burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns. in addition, the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace and/or authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases. the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier ("sni"). in march 2010, fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified package-level snis, as an initial step in the fda's development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain. the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations.      the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase, store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation, our business and our results of operations.          the dea, fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. we are required to hold valid dea and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. the dea, fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our distribution centers' licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products (including controlled substances), seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.      legal, regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations.          both our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. 8 table of contents          federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010. the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. when fully implemented, these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of prescription drug costs. the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations.          the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average manufacturer price ("amp"). the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") have released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology. while the draft federal upper limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place, the impact of the cms methodology cannot be determined until finalized. any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.          the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting medicaid rebate amounts. the affordable care act's redefinition of amp is expected to result, in most instances, in a higher amp. this higher amp, coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage, is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, which could indirectly impact our business. cms issued proposed regulations to implement the aca's provisions regarding medicaid rebates and medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies, but the regulations have not been finalized to date. we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business. the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts. for example, a number of states have announced plans to use average acquisition cost to reimburse pharmacies for the cost of drugs. there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.          in february 2011, cms announced that it would be conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs, the results of which states may use to determine state-specific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. cms will use pharmacies' invoiced drug acquisition costs as reported in the surveys to calculate the national average drug acquisition cost ("nadac"). cms released its draft methodology for calculating the nadac in may 2012, and began collecting survey data in june 2012. cms has not yet released any calculated nadacs. there can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates derived from this new survey data will not result in lower medicaid reimbursement levels or lead to other payers reducing their reimbursement levels that could adversely impact our business.          our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs, primarily those used in oncology, and may, in the future, be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs. several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs, including expanded warning and product safety labeling requirements, more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and more conservative guidelines for recommended dosage and use. any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues. in addition, on january 1, 2011, cms began implementing a prospective payment system for medicare end-stage renal disease (esrd) services that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most esrd services, including anemia drugs. there is a 4-year transition period to the new prospective payment system. we cannot at this time assess the impact this new payment system, when fully implemented, will have on our business.          the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program. the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel, which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability. there have been additional changes to the part d program since its enactment. notably, the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d "coverage gap" (including a manufacturer discount program), mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces part d subsidies for certain high-income beneficiaries. cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules. there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business. 9 table of contents          the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities. for instance, the budget control act of 2011 established a congressional committee charged with identifying $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction provisions, which could include reductions in medicare and/or medicaid spending. the budget control act of 2011 also provided for automatic federal spending cuts of $1.2 trillion in january 2013, a process known as sequestration, if congress failed to adopt legislation meeting federal deficit reduction targets by january 2012. reductions in payments to medicare providers under this process would be capped at 2%, while medicaid would be exempt from such reductions. the committee did not meet the statutory deadline for producing deficit reduction legislation and; therefore, sequestration will be triggered in january 2013 unless congress and the white house are able to reach agreement on deficit reduction items before that time. any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. at this time, we can provide no assurances that future medicare and/or medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have an adverse effect on our business.      absg's business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors.          absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians. drugs that are administered in a physician's office, such as drugs that are infused or injected, are typically covered under medicare part b. declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices, including some customers, to move from private practice to hospital settings, where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg. this trend may continue due to various factors, including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price ("asp") for medicare part b drugs. because medicare currently reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of asp plus six percent, changes in asp have reduced and could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs. these reductions could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by hospitals, and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in absg's profitability. in addition, deficit reduction measures pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 could include reductions in medicare spending, such as lower reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs. any future reductions in the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. at this time, we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes, if adopted, would not have an adverse effect on our business.      changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability.          our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. these changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.      if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.          we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs. legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act. while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 10 table of contents      the enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in canada, including the profitability of that business.          consistent with our operations in the united states, our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in canada. the purchase of pharmaceutical products in canada is funded in part by the provincial governments, which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently. in recent years, like the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. for example, in 2006, the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act, which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario. on july 1, 2010, the ontario government finalized regulatory changes to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs in ontario to reduce costs for taxpayers. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public (government-sponsored plans) and private markets and the elimination of professional allowances paid to pharmacists. changes in generic drug prices also affect the cash values of the percentage mark-ups that may be charged by pharmacies. these reforms may result in lower service fees, cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. in addition, any fees based on percentage of drug prices will be reduced by any reductions to generic drug prices themselves. legislation and/or regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well. the legislative changes in ontario had an immediate impact on quebec because it requires manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals to quebec at the lowest price in canada. the governments of alberta and british columbia have also taken steps to reduce the prices for generic drugs listed on their formularies. we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in canada. revenue from our canadian operations in fiscal 2012 was approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue.      our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation.          violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. among other things, such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed. the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. under false claims acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of branded pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of such products. such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise. our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters and/or we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.          on october 24, 2011, we announced that we had reached a preliminary agreement for a civil settlement (the "preliminary settlement") with the united states attorney's office for the eastern district of new york, the plaintiff states and the relator (collectively, the "plaintiffs") of the claims in a civil case that was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts (the "district of massachusetts case") under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts against two business units of the company, which are subsidiaries of amerisourcebergen specialty group: international nephrology network ("inn"), a group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices, and asd specialty healthcare, inc. ("asd"), which is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices. the relator was a former employee of amgen, inc., which was also a defendant in the case. the civil case was administratively closed after the preliminary settlement was reached. the preliminary settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement with the plaintiffs, which we expect to finalize in fiscal year 2013. we do not expect inn or asd to admit any liability in connection with the settlement. we recorded a $16 million charge in fiscal 2011 in connection with the preliminary settlement. the matter is described in note 12 (legal matters and contingencies) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k.          in addition, we have learned that there are prior and subsequent filings in one or more federal district courts, including a complaint filed by one of our former employees, that are under seal and involve allegations against the company (and/or subsidiaries or businesses of the company, including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business) similar to those raised in the district of massachusetts case. the preliminary settlement encompasses resolution of one of these other filings. with regard to any of these filings not encompassed by the preliminary settlement, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases and/or we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases.      our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate.          we expect to continue to execute our growth strategy, in part, by acquiring companies. at any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations. 11 table of contents          acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties. if we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.      our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations.          our operations in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. are subject to various risks inherent in global operations. the acquisition of world courier expanded our business globally, with operations in over 50 countries worldwide. we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition (as described above). at any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local political changes and local economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition. the realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.      violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.          we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. for example, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), u.s. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the u.k. bribery act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. the fcpa generally prohibits u.s. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the fcpa also requires that u.s. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. if we are found to have violated the fcpa, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses. from time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.      risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations.          our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.          information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. as a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.          third party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems. our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily.          certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems. to the extent the implementation of these systems fail, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.      anticipated benefits generally associated with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system may not be fully realized.          we are nearing the completion of the implementation of an erp system, which, when completed, will handle the business and financial processes within abdc's operations and our corporate and administrative functions, such as: (i) facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution centers; (ii) receiving, processing, and shipping orders on a timely basis, (iii) managing the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers; (iv) processing payments to our suppliers; and (v) generating financial transactions and information. if the anticipated benefits from this implementation are not fully realized, our expected return on the erp investment will not be achieved. 12 table of contents      tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          we are a large corporation with operations in the united states, puerto rico, canada and select global markets. as such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. in addition, united states federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. 13 table of contents item 1b.    unresolved
