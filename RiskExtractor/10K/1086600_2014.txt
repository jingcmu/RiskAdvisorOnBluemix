item 1a.             risk factors   risks inherent in an investment in us   cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and other external factors.   the amount of cash we can distribute to holders of our common units or other partnership securities each quarter principally depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:   ·                  the amount of coal we are able to produce from our properties; ·                  the price at which we are able to sell coal, which is affected by the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal; ·                  the level of our operating costs; ·                  weather conditions and patterns; ·                  the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities; ·                  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; ·                  regulatory, administrative and judicial decisions; ·                  competition within our industry; ·                  the price and availability of alternative fuels; ·                  the effect of worldwide energy consumption; and ·                  prevailing economic conditions.   in addition, the actual amount of cash available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:   ·                  the level of our capital expenditures; ·                  the cost of acquisitions, if any; ·                  our debt service requirements and restrictions on distributions contained in our current or future debt agreements; ·                  fluctuations in our working capital needs; ·                  unavailability of financing resulting in unanticipated liquidity restraints; ·                  our ability to borrow under our credit agreement to make distributions to our unitholders; and ·                  the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by our managing general partner, in its discretion, for the proper conduct of our business.   because of these and other factors, we may not have sufficient available cash to pay a specific level of cash distributions to our unitholders.  furthermore, the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowing, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items.  as a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses and may be unable to make cash distributions during periods when we record net income.  please read risks related to our business for a discussion of further risks affecting our ability to generate available cash.   we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests, on terms and conditions established by our managing general partner, without the consent of our unitholders, which will dilute your ownership interest in us and may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level.   the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:   ·                  our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; ·                  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease; ·                  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; ·                  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; and ·                  the market price of our common units may decline.   20 table of contents   the market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public markets, including sales by our existing unitholders.   as of december 31, 2013, ahgp owned 15,544,169 of our common units.  ahgp also owns our managing general partner.  in the future, ahgp may sell some or all of these units or it may distribute our common units to the holders of its equity interests and those holders may dispose of some or all of these units.  the sale or disposition of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities.  we do not know whether any such sales would be made in the public market or in private placements, nor do we know what impact such potential or actual sales would have on our unit price in the future.   an increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.   like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks. in exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments.  accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded limited partnership interests.  reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.   the credit and risk profile of our managing general partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile.   the credit and risk profile of our managing general partner or its owners may be factors in credit evaluations of us as a master limited partnership.  this is because our managing general partner can exercise significant influence or control over our business activities, including our cash distribution policy, acquisition strategy and business risk profile.  another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of ahgp, including the degree of its financial leverage and its dependence on cash flow from us to service its indebtedness.   ahgp is principally dependent on the cash distributions from its general and limited partner equity interests in us to service any indebtedness.  any distribution by us to ahgp will be made only after satisfying our then-current obligations to our creditors.  our credit ratings and risk profile could be adversely affected if the ratings and risk profiles of ahgp and the entities that control it were viewed as substantially lower or more risky than ours.   our unitholders do not elect our managing general partner or vote on our managing general partners officers or directors.  as of december 31, 2013, ahgp owned approximately 42.1% of our outstanding units, a sufficient number to block any attempt to remove our managing general partner.   unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business.  unitholders did not elect our managing general partner and will have no right to elect our managing general partner on an annual or other continuing basis.   in addition, if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our managing general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner.  our managing general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 66.7% of our outstanding units.  as of december 31, 2013, ahgp held approximately 42.1% of our outstanding units.  consequently, it is not currently possible for our managing general partner to be removed without the consent of ahgp.  as a result, the price at which our units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.   furthermore, unitholders voting rights are also restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement that provides that any units held by a person that owns 20.0% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our managing general partner and its affiliates, cannot be voted on any matter.   21 table of contents   the control of our managing general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.   our managing general partner may transfer its general partner interest in us to a third party in a merger or in a sale of its equity securities without the consent of our unitholders.  furthermore, there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the members of our managing general partner to sell or transfer all or part of their ownership interest in our managing general partner to a third party.  the new owner or owners of our managing general partner would then be in a position to replace the directors and officers of our managing general partner and control the decisions made and actions taken by the board of directors and officers.   unitholders may be required to sell their units to our managing general partner at an undesirable time or price.   if at any time less than 20.0% of our outstanding common units are held by persons other than our general partners and their affiliates, our managing general partner will have the right to acquire all, but not less than all, of those units at a price no less than their then-current market price.  as a consequence, a unitholder may be required to sell his common units at an undesirable time or price.  our managing general partner may assign this purchase right to any of its affiliates or to us.   cost reimbursements due to our general partners may be substantial and may reduce our ability to pay distributions to unitholders.   prior to making any distributions to our unitholders, we will reimburse our general partners and their affiliates for all expenses they have incurred on our behalf.  the reimbursement of these expenses and the payment of these fees could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to the unitholders.  our managing general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses and fees.  for additional information, please see item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsrelated-party transactionsadministrative services, and item 8. financial statements and supplementary datanote 18. related-party transactions.   we depend on the leadership and involvement of joseph w. craft iii and other key personnel for the success of our business.   we depend on the leadership and involvement of mr. craft, a director and president and chief executive officer of our managing general partner.  mr. craft has been integral to our success, due in part to his ability to identify and develop internal growth projects and accretive acquisitions, make strategic decisions and attract and retain key personnel.  the loss of his leadership and involvement or the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   your liability as a limited partner may not be limited, and our unitholders may have to repay distributions or make additional contributions to us under certain circumstances.   as a limited partner in a partnership organized under delaware law, you could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if you participate in the control of our business.  our general partners generally have unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partners.  additionally, the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions.   under certain circumstances, our unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them.  under delaware law, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets.  delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the partnership for the distribution amount.  liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.   22 table of contents   our partnership agreement limits our managing general partners fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partners that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.   our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our managing general partner and its affiliates and which reduce the obligations to which our managing general partner would otherwise be held by state-law fiduciary duty standards.  the following is a summary of the material restrictions contained in our partnership agreement on the fiduciary duties owed by our general partners to the limited partners. our partnership agreement:   ·                  permits our managing general partner to make a number of decisions in its sole discretion.  this entitles our managing general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner; ·                  provides that our managing general partner is entitled to make other decisions in its reasonable discretion; ·      generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not involving a required vote of unitholders must be fair and reasonable to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable, our managing general partner may consider the interests of all parties involved, including its own. unless our managing general partner has acted in bad faith, the action taken by our managing general partner shall not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duty; and ·                  provides that our general partners and our officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions if our general partners and those other persons acted in good faith.   in becoming a limited partner of our partnership, a common unitholder is bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.   some of our executive officers and directors face potential conflicts of interest in managing our business.   certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of ahgp.  these relationships may create conflicts of interest regarding corporate opportunities and other matters.  the resolution of any such conflicts may not always be in our or our unitholders best interests.  in addition, these overlapping executive officers and directors allocate their time among us and ahgp.  these officers and directors face potential conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   our managing general partners discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.   our partnership agreement requires our managing general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that in its reasonable discretion are necessary for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners.  these cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders.   our general partners have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities, which may permit our general partners to favor their own interests to the detriment of our unitholders.   conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of relationships between our general partners and their affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand.  as a result of these conflicts our general partners may favor their own interests and those of their affiliates over the interests of our unitholders.  the nature of these conflicts includes the following considerations:   ·                  remedies available to our unitholders for actions that might, without the limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary duty are limited.  unitholders are deemed to have consented to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be deemed a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. ·                  our managing general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties in addition to us in resolving conflicts of interest, thereby limiting its fiduciary duties to our unitholders. ·                  our general partners affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those in direct competition with us, except as provided in the omnibus agreement (please see item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independenceomnibus agreement).   23 table of contents   ·                  our managing general partner determines the amount and timing of our asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to unitholders. ·                  our managing general partner determines whether to issue additional units or other equity securities in us. ·                  our managing general partner determines which costs are reimbursable by us. ·                  our managing general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it. ·                  our managing general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us. ·                  our managing general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf. ·                  in some instances our managing general partner may borrow funds in order to permit the payment of distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions.   risks related to our business   global economic conditions or economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate as well as sustained uncertainty in financial markets may have material adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.   continued or renewed weakness in global economic conditions or economic conditions in any of the industries we serve or in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.  for example:   ·                  the demand for electricity in the u.s. may not fully recover or may decline if economic conditions deteriorate, which may negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our business; ·                  any inability of our customers to raise capital could adversely affect their ability to honor their obligations to us; and ·                  our future ability to access the capital markets may be restricted as a result of future economic conditions, which could materially impact our ability to grow our business, including development of our coal reserves.   a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could negatively impact our results of operations.   our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal, as well as our ability to improve productivity and control costs.  the prices we receive for our production depends upon factors beyond our control, including:   ·                  the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal; ·                  weather conditions and patterns; ·                  the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities; ·                  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; ·                  the price and availability of alternative fuels; ·                  the effect of worldwide energy consumption; and ·                  prevailing economic conditions.   any adverse change in these factors could result in weaker demand and lower prices for our products.  a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our revenues to the extent we are not protected by the terms of existing coal supply agreements.   competition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal, and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices.   we compete with other coal producers in various regions of the u.s. for domestic coal sales.  the most important factors on which we compete are delivered price (i.e., the cost of coal delivered to the customer, including transportation costs, which are generally paid by our customers either directly or indirectly), coal quality characteristics, contract flexibility (i.e., volume optionality and multiple supply sources) and reliability of supply.  some competitors may have, among other things, larger financial and operating resources, lower per ton cost of production, or relationships with specific transportation providers.  the competition among coal producers may impact our ability to retain or attract   24 table of contents   customers and could adversely impact our revenues and cash available for distribution.   in addition, declining prices from an oversupply of coal in the market could reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution.   any change in consumption patterns by utilities regarding the use of coal could affect our ability to sell the coal we produce.   the domestic electric utility industry accounts for over 92% of domestic coal consumption.  the amount of coal consumed by the domestic electric utility industry is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, environmental and other governmental regulations, and the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear, natural gas and fuel oil as well as alternative sources of energy.  for example, the relatively low price of natural gas has resulted, in some instances, in utilities increasing natural gas consumption while decreasing coal consumption.  future environmental regulation of ghg emissions could accelerate the use by utilities of fuels other than coal.  in addition, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources could affect demand for coal.  a number of states have enacted mandates that require electricity suppliers to rely on renewable energy sources in generating a certain percentage of power.  such mandates, combined with other incentives to use renewable energy sources, such as tax credits, could make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal. a decrease in coal consumption by the domestic electric utility industry could adversely affect the price of coal, which could negatively impact our results of operations and reduce our cash available for distribution.   extensive environmental laws and regulations affect coal consumers, and have corresponding effects on the demand for coal as a fuel source.   federal, state and local laws and regulations extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from coal-fired electric power plants, which are the ultimate consumers of much of our coal.  these laws and regulations can require significant emission control expenditures for many coal-fired power plants, and various new and proposed laws and regulations may require further emission reductions and associated emission control expenditures.  these laws and regulations may affect demand and prices for coal.  there is also continuing pressure on state and federal regulators to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants, particularly coal-fired power plants.  further, far-reaching federal regulations promulgated by epa in the last four years, such as csapr and mats, have led to the premature retirement of coal-fired generating units and a significant reduction in the amount of coal-fired generating capacity in the u.s.  while csapr was struck down by the d.c. circuit court of appeals and many of the other rules, including mats, are currently being legally challenged by states and private parties, utilities and other generators of electricity made retirement decisions and retired some units based upon epas proposed and finalized rules.  in june 2013, the president directed epa to propose co2 emissions requirements for existing and modified power plants by june 1, 2014 and to finalize the requirements by june 1, 2015.  as a result of these current and proposed laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives, electricity generators may elect to switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions or by-products, further reducing demand for coal.  please read item 1. businessregulation and lawsair emissions, carbon dioxide emissions and hazardous substances and wastes.   increased regulation of ghg emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for coal as a fuel source, which could reduce demand for our products, decrease our revenues and reduce our profitability.   combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce, results in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  on december 15, 2009, epa published the endangerment finding asserting that emissions of carbon dioxide and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, and epa has begun to regulate ghg emissions pursuant to the caa.  epa has proposed to regulate ghg emissions from new power plants.  the standard proposed is a natural gas standard and would effectively prevent construction of new coal fired power plants.  epa has not proposed to regulate ghg emissions from modified or existing power plants, but could attempt to do so in the future.  in addition, it is possible more federal legislation or regulations could be adopted in the future to restrict ghg emissions, as president obama has expressed support for a mandatory cap and trade program to restrict or regulate emissions of ghgs and congress has recently considered various proposals to reduce ghg emissions.  many states and regions have adopted ghg initiatives.  also, there have been numerous protests of, and challenges to, the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to ghg emissions.  please read item 1. businessregulation and lawsair emissions and carbon dioxide emissions.   future international, federal and state initiatives to control carbon dioxide emissions could result in increased costs associated with coal production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide   25 table of contents   emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs.  such increased costs for coal consumption could result in reduced demand for coal and some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  in addition, the increased difficulty or inability of our customers to obtain permits for construction of new or expansion of existing coal-fired power plants could adversely affect demand for our coal and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.   plaintiffs in federal court litigation have attempted to pursue tort claims based on the alleged effects of climate change.   in 2004, eight states and new york city sued five electric utility companies in connecticut v. american electric power co.  invoking the federal and state common law of public nuisance, plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring defendants to abate their contribution to the nuisance of climate change by capping carbon dioxide emissions and then reducing them.  in june 2011, the u.s. supreme court issued a unanimous decision holding that the plaintiffs federal common law claims were displaced by federal legislation and regulations.  the u.s. supreme court did not address the plaintiffs state law tort claims and remanded the issue of preemption for the district court to consider.  while the u.s. supreme court held that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions, tort-type liabilities remain a possibility and a source of concern.  proliferation of successful climate change litigation could adversely impact demand for coal and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   the stability and profitability of our operations could be adversely affected if our customers do not honor existing contracts or do not extend existing or enter into new long-term contracts for coal.   in 2013, we sold approximately 93.5% of our sales tonnage under contracts having a term greater than one year, which we refer to as long-term contracts.  long-term sales contracts have historically provided a relatively secure market for the amount of production committed under the terms of the contracts.  from time to time industry conditions may make it more difficult for us to enter into long-term contracts with our electric utility customers, and if supply exceeds demand in the coal industry, electric utilities may become less willing to lock in price or quantity commitments for an extended period of time.  accordingly, we may not be able to continue to obtain long-term sales contracts with reliable customers as existing contracts expire, which could subject a portion of our revenue stream to the increased volatility of the spot market.   some of our long-term coal sales contracts contain provisions allowing for the renegotiation of prices and, in some instances, the termination of the contract or the suspension of purchases by customers.   some of our long-term contracts contain provisions that allow for the purchase price to be renegotiated at periodic intervals.  these price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on the prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to the contract to agree on a new price.  any adjustment or renegotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect our operating profit margins.  accordingly, long-term contracts may provide only limited protection during adverse market conditions.  in some circumstances, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a reopener provision can also lead to early termination of a contract.   several of our long-term contracts also contain provisions that allow the customer to suspend or terminate performance under the contract upon the occurrence or continuation of certain events that are beyond the customers reasonable control.  such events may include labor disputes, mechanical malfunctions and changes in government regulations, including changes in environmental regulations rendering use of our coal inconsistent with the customers environmental compliance strategies.  additionally, most of our long-term contracts contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics.  failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts.  in the event of early termination of any of our long-term contracts, if we are unable to enter into new contracts on similar terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.   we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one or more significant customers could affect our ability to maintain the sales volume and price of the coal we produce.   during 2013, we derived approximately 26.5% of our total revenues from two customers and at least 10.0% of our 2013 total revenues from each of the two.  if we were to lose either of these customers without finding replacement   26 table of contents   customers willing to purchase an equivalent amount of coal on similar terms, or if these customers were to decrease the amounts of coal purchased or the terms, including pricing terms, on which they buy coal from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   litigation resulting from disputes with our customers may result in substantial costs, liabilities and loss of revenues.   from time to time we have disputes with our customers over the provisions of long-term coal supply contracts relating to, among other things, coal pricing, quality, quantity and the existence of specified conditions beyond our or our customers control that suspend performance obligations under the particular contract.  disputes may occur in the future and we may not be able to resolve those disputes in a satisfactory manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.   our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers.  if the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly, our business could be adversely affected.  in addition, if a customer refuses to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation, our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customers contractual obligations are honored.   our profitability may decline due to unanticipated mine operating conditions and other events that are not within our control and that may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.   our mining operations are influenced by changing conditions or events that can affect production levels and costs at particular mines for varying lengths of time and, as a result, can diminish our profitability.  these conditions and events include, among others:   ·                  fires; ·                  mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems; ·                  unavailability of required equipment; ·                  prices for fuel, steel, explosives and other supplies; ·                  fines and penalties incurred as a result of alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations; ·                  variations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal; ·                  amounts of overburden, partings, rock and other natural materials; ·                  weather conditions, such as heavy rains, flooding, ice and other storms; ·                  accidental mine water discharges and other geological conditions; ·                  employee injuries or fatalities; ·                  labor-related interruptions; ·                  increased reclamation costs; ·                  inability to acquire, maintain or renew mining rights or permits in a timely manner, if at all; ·                  fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation; and ·                  unexpected operational interruptions due to other factors.   these conditions have had, and can be expected in the future to have, a significant impact on our operating results.  prolonged disruption of production at any of our mines would result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability, which could materially adversely impact our quarterly or annual results.   effective october 1, 2013, we renewed our annual property and casualty insurance program.  the aggregate maximum limit in the commercial property program is $100.0 million per occurrence excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage, a 90 or 120-day waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and a $10.0 million overall aggregate deductible.  we may experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future.   27 table of contents   we do not control, and therefore may not be able to cause or prevent certain actions by, white oak.   white oak is governed by its board of representatives and, while we are represented on such board, we will not control all of its decisions.  consequently, it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause white oak to take actions that we believe would be in our or its best interests, and we may be unable to control the amount and timing of cash we will receive from white oaks operations. likewise, the white oak board may control the timing of certain capital investments we are committed to making in white oak.  the lack of control over timing of such revenues and costs could have an adverse impact on the benefits we expect to achieve from the white oak transactions.   a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs and could adversely affect our profitability.   efficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with at least one year of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks.  in recent years, a shortage of experienced coal miners has caused us to include some inexperienced staff in the operation of certain mining units, which decreases our productivity and increases our costs.  this shortage of experienced coal miners is the result of a significant percentage of experienced coal miners reaching retirement age, combined with the difficulty of retaining existing workers in and attracting new workers to the coal industry.  thus, this shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period. if the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for coal, which could adversely affect our profitability.   although none of our employees are members of unions, our work force may not remain union-free in the future.   none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements.  however, all of our work force may not remain union-free in the future, and legislative, regulatory or other governmental action could make it more difficult to remain union-free.  if some or all of our currently union-free operations were to become unionized, it could adversely affect our productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages at our mining complexes.  in addition, even if we remain union-free, our operations may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies, particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against our operations.   our mining operations are subject to extensive and costly laws and regulations, and such current and future laws and regulations could increase current operating costs or limit our ability to produce coal.   we are subject to numerous and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the coal mining industry, including laws and regulations pertaining to employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air and water quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge or release of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability.  certain of these laws and regulations may impose strict liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct.  failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting the performance of operations.  complying with these laws and regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.  the possibility exists that new laws or regulations may be adopted, or that judicial interpretations or more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations may occur, which could materially affect our mining operations, cash flow, and profitability, either through direct impacts on our mining operations, or indirect impacts that discourage or limit our customers use of coal.  please read item 1. businessregulations and laws.   state and federal laws addressing mine safety practices impose stringent reporting requirements and civil and criminal penalties for violations.  federal and state regulatory agencies continue to interpret and implement these laws and propose new regulations and standards.  implementing and complying with these laws and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our operational expense and to have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position.  for more information, please read item 1. businessregulation and lawsmine health and safety laws.   28 table of contents   we may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, which could reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.   mining companies must obtain numerous governmental permits or approvals that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining.  the permitting rules are complex and can change over time.  regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance.  the public has the right to comment on permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process, including through court intervention.  accordingly, permits required to conduct our operations may not be issued, maintained or renewed, or may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to economically conduct our mining operations.  limitations on our ability to conduct our mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits or similar approvals could reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.  please read item 1. businessregulations and lawsmining permits and approvals.   the epa has begun reviewing permits required for the discharge of overburden from mining operations under section 404 of the cwa.  various initiatives by the epa regarding these permits have increased the time required to obtain and the costs of complying with such permits.  in addition, the epa previously exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of previously issued permits in connection with one of the largest surface mining operations in central appalachia, although that action was ultimately overturned by a federal court.  as a result of these developments, we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in securing, utilizing or renewing section 404 permits required for our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position.  please read item 1. businessregulations and lawswater discharge.   fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing our ability to supply coal to our customers.   transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision.  increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make our coal production less competitive than coal produced from other sources.  disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.  our transportation providers may face difficulties in the future that may impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, resulting in decreased revenues.  if there are disruptions of the transportation services provided by our primary rail or barge carriers that transport our coal and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers to ship our coal, our business could be adversely affected.   conversely, significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country.  for instance, difficulty in coordinating the many eastern coal loading facilities, the large number of small shipments, the steeper average grades of the terrain and a more unionized workforce are all issues that combine to make coal shipments originating in the eastern u.s. inherently more expensive on a per-mile basis than coal shipments originating in the western u.s.  historically, high coal transportation rates from the western coal producing areas into certain eastern markets limited the use of western coal in those markets.  lower rail rates from the western coal producing areas to markets served by eastern u.s. coal producers have created major competitive challenges for eastern coal producers.  in the event of lower transportation costs, the increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   in recent years, the states of kentucky and west virginia have increased enforcement of weight limits on coal trucks on their public roads.  it is possible that all states in which our coal is transported by truck may modify their laws to limit truck weight limits.  such legislation and enforcement efforts could result in shipment delays and increased costs.  an increase in transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production and could adversely affect revenues.   we may not be able to successfully grow through future acquisitions.   since our formation and the acquisition of our predecessor in august 1999, we have expanded our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent and neighboring properties.  we continually seek to expand our operations and coal reserves.  our future growth could be limited if we are unable to continue to make acquisitions, or if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties we acquire.  we may not be successful in consummating any acquisitions and the consequences of undertaking these acquisitions are   29 table of contents   unknown.  moreover, any acquisition could be dilutive to earnings and distributions to unitholders and any additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition could affect our ability to make distributions to unitholders.  our ability to make acquisitions in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates.   mine expansions and acquisitions involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.   if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties we acquire, our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  expansion and acquisition transactions involve various inherent risks, including:   ·                  uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent and other liabilities (including environmental or mine safety liabilities) of, expansion and acquisition opportunities; ·                  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion or an acquisition; ·                  problems that could arise from the integration of the new operations; and ·      unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion or acquisition opportunity.   any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from an expansion or acquisition. any expansion or acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. in addition, future expansions or acquisitions could result in us assuming more long-term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets than we have assumed in our previous expansions and/or acquisitions.   completion of growth projects and future expansion could require significant amounts of financing which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.   we plan to fund capital expenditures for our current growth projects with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity.  our funding plans may, however, be negatively impacted by numerous factors, including higher than anticipated capital expenditures or lower than expected cash flow from operations.  in addition, we may be unable to refinance our current revolving credit facility when it expires or obtain adequate funding prior to expiry because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations.  furthermore, additional growth projects and expansion opportunities may develop in the future which could also require significant amounts of financing that may not be available to us on acceptable terms or in the amounts we expect, or at all.   various factors could adversely impact the debt and equity capital markets as well as our credit ratings or our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our current debt agreements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  if we are unable to finance our growth and future expansions as expected, we could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may not be attractive to us, or to revise or cancel our plans.   the unavailability of an adequate supply of coal reserves that can be mined at competitive costs could cause our profitability to decline.   our profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine coal reserves that have the geological characteristics that enable them to be mined at competitive costs and to meet the quality needed by our customers. because we deplete our reserves as we mine coal, our future success and growth depend, in part, upon our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable.  replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, may not be mineable at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines.  we may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any reserves that we acquire, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.  exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by such mines. our ability to obtain other reserves in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal   30 table of contents   companies for attractive properties, the lack of suitable acquisition candidates or the inability to acquire coal properties on commercially reasonable terms.   the estimates of our coal reserves may prove inaccurate and could result in decreased profitability.   the estimates of our coal reserves may vary substantially from actual amounts of coal we are able to economically recover. the reserve data set forth in item 2. properties represent our engineering estimates.  all of the reserves presented in this annual report on form 10-k constitute proven and probable reserves.  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond our control.  estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, any one of which may vary considerably from actual results.  these factors and assumptions relate to:   ·      geological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine; ·                  the percentage of coal in the ground ultimately recoverable; ·                  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; ·                  the assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies; and ·                  assumptions concerning future coal prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs.   for these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities of coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variations may be material.  any inaccuracy in the estimates of our reserves could result in higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.   mining in certain areas in which we operate is more difficult and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the u.s., which could affect the mining operations and cost structures of these areas.   the geological characteristics of some of our coal reserves, such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness, make them difficult and costly to mine.  as mines become depleted, replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, may not be mineable at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines.  in addition, permitting, licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements associated with certain of our mining operations are more costly and time-consuming to satisfy.  these factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of, and our customers ability to use coal produced by, our mines.   some of our operating subsidiaries lease a portion of the surface properties upon which their mining facilities are located.   our operating subsidiaries do not, in all instances, own all of the surface properties upon which their mining facilities have been constructed.  certain of the operating companies have constructed and now operate all or some portion of their facilities on properties owned by unrelated third parties with whom our subsidiary has entered into a long-term lease.  we have no reason to believe that there exists any risk of loss of these leasehold rights given the terms and provisions of the subject leases and the nature and identity of the third-party lessors; however, in the unlikely event of any loss of these leasehold rights, operations could be disrupted or otherwise adversely impacted as a result of increased costs associated with retaining the necessary land use.   unexpected increases in raw material costs could significantly impair our operating profitability.   our coal mining operations are affected by commodity prices.  we use significant amounts of steel, petroleum products and other raw materials in various pieces of mining equipment, supplies and materials, including the roof bolts required by the room-and-pillar method of mining.  steel prices and the prices of scrap steel, natural gas and coking coal consumed in the production of iron and steel fluctuate significantly and may change unexpectedly.  there may be acts of nature or terrorist attacks or threats that could also impact the future costs of raw materials.  future volatility in the price of steel, petroleum products or other raw materials will impact our operational expenses and could result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.   31 table of contents   our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, make distributions to unitholders or capitalize on business opportunities.   we have long-term indebtedness, consisting of our outstanding senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility and term loan agreement.  at december 31, 2013, our total long-term indebtedness outstanding was $868.0 million.  our leverage may:   ·                  adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs; ·                  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business opportunities; ·                  make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic or operating conditions; and ·                  make it more difficult to self-insure for our workers compensation obligations.   in addition, we have unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. future borrowings, under our credit facilities or otherwise, could result in a significant increase in our leverage.   our payments of principal and interest on any indebtedness will reduce the cash available for distribution on our units. we will be prohibited from making cash distributions:   ·                  during an event of default under any of our indebtedness; or ·                  if either before or after such distribution, we fail to meet a coverage test based on the ratio of our consolidated debt to our consolidated cash flow.   various limitations in our debt agreements may reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities.  any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions.   federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations related to statutory reclamation requirements and workers compensation and black lung benefits. our inability to acquire or failure to maintain surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us.   federal and state laws require us to place and maintain bonds to secure our obligations to repair and return property to its approximate original state after it has been mined (often referred to as reclaim or reclamation), to pay federal and state workers compensation and pneumoconiosis, or black lung, benefits and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations.  these bonds provide assurance that we will perform our statutorily required obligations and are referred to as surety bonds. these bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis.  the failure to maintain or the inability to acquire sufficient surety bonds, as required by state and federal laws, could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our mining permits. such failure could result from a variety of factors, including:   ·                  lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of new surety bonds; ·                  the ability of current and future surety bond issuers to increase required collateral, or limitations on availability of collateral for surety bond issuers due to the terms of our credit agreements; and ·                  the exercise by third-party surety bond holders of their rights to refuse to renew the surety.   we have outstanding surety bonds with governmental agencies for reclamation, federal and state workers compensation and other obligations.  we may have difficulty maintaining our surety bonds for mine reclamation as well as workers compensation and black lung benefits.  in addition, those governmental agencies may increase the amount of bonding required.  our inability to acquire or failure to maintain these bonds, or a substantial increase in the bonding requirements, would have a material adverse effect on us.   we and our subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, which may have a material effect on our business.   we are party to a number of legal proceedings incident to our normal business activities. there is the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of multiple matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. please see item 8. financial statements and supplementary datanote 19.  commitments and contingencies for further discussion.   32 table of contents   tax risks to our common unitholders   our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states.  if the internal revenue service (irs) treats us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced.   the anticipated after-tax benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes.   despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a qualifying income requirement. based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. however, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the irs on this or any other matter affecting us. failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.   if we were treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would pay u.s. federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely be liable for state income tax at varying rates.  distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders.  because taxes would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.  therefore, our treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units.   our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for u.s. federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution (mqd) amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.  at the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation.  if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity, the cash available for distribution to you would be reduced and the value of our common units could be negatively impacted.   the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.   the present u.s. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. for example, from time to time, members of congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing u.s. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. one such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. any modification to u.s. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the qualifying income requirement to be treated as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes.   if the irs were to contest the federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.   we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions that we take, even positions taken with the advice of counsel. it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take.  a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take.  any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the prices at which they trade.  moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the irs will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.   33 table of contents   even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us, you will be required to pay taxes on your share of our taxable income.   you will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on your share of our taxable income, whether or not you receive cash distributions from us. you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability results from your share of our taxable income.   tax gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more or less than expected.   if you sell your units, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those units. because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease in your tax basis in your units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such units at a price greater than your tax basis therein, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost. furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to you due to potential recapture items, including depreciation and depletion recapture.  in addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholders share of our non-recourse liabilities, if you sell your units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale.   tax-exempt entities and non-u.s. persons owning our units face unique tax issues that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.   investment in our units by tax-exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts (iras) and non-u.s. persons, raises issues unique to them. for example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax, including iras and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. allocations and/or distributions to non-u.s. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-u.s. persons will be required to file u.s. federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.  if you are a tax exempt entity or a non-u.s. person, you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units.   we treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the units purchased. the irs may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our units.   because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units and because of other reasons, we adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations. a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.   we prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred.  the irs may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.   we generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred.  the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations.  the u.s. treasury department has issued proposed treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders.  nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted.  if the irs were to challenge our proration method or new treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.   34 table of contents   a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a short seller to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. if so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.   because there is no tax concept of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units.  in that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition.  moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income.  unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.   we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders.  the irs may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.   when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner.  our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets.  in that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders.  moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our intangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our tangible assets.  the irs may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders.   a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.   certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to coal mining and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.   the obama administration has indicated a desire to eliminate certain key u.s. federal income tax provisions currently applicable to coal companies, including the percentage depletion allowance with respect to coal properties.  no legislation with that effect has been proposed and elimination of those provisions would not impact our financial statements or results of operations.  however, elimination of the provisions could result in unfavorable tax consequences for our unitholders and, as a result, could negatively impact our unit price.   the sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a twelve-month period will result in the termination of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.   we will be considered to have terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period.  for purposes of determining
