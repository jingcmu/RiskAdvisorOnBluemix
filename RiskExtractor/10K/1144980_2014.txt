item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained and referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could cause our actual future results, performance or achievements to be materially different from or could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. uncertainty in the automotive retail environment could present challenges for our dealerships and adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.  although the automotive retail industry has shown continued improvement in recent periods from the unprecedented challenging environment which began in 2008, we believe that the long-term prospects for the full industry and general economy continue to be difficult to predict. during the downturn in the automotive retailing industry, our results of operations were adversely affected, and could again be adversely affected by the uncertainty in present and expected economic conditions, including any increased difficulty for consumers in securing vehicle financing due to rising interest rates or continued higher than recent historical average unemployment levels. if consumer financing becomes more difficult to obtain, the new vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rate ("saar") could be negatively impacted, which in turn could further adversely impact our results of operations, our cash flows and ultimately our liquidity. if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flows, we may need to enter into certain extraordinary transactions in order to generate additional cash, which may include, but not be limited to, selling certain of our dealerships or other assets or increasing borrowings under our existing, or any future, credit facilities. there can be no assurance that, if necessary, we will be able to enter into any such transactions in a timely manner or on reasonable terms, if at all. furthermore, in the event we were required to sell dealership assets, the sale of any material portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. our dealerships’ profitability depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry, and the availability to us of such popular vehicles. the profitability of our dealerships depends in large part on customer demand for the vehicle lines they carry. historically, we have generated most of our revenue through new vehicle sales. new vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher-margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and services. as a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers. more popular vehicles may often be difficult to obtain from manufacturers. manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership, and in some instances on the level of capital expenditures associated with such dealerships. if our dealerships experience prolonged periods of sales declines or do not make adequate capital expenditures, those manufacturers may reduce their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and, as a result, our new vehicle sales and profits may decline. in addition, a general reduction in demand for new vehicles, or an oversupply of such vehicles, could result in a need for us to sell vehicles at a lower price, reducing our revenue per new vehicle sold and our new vehicle margins. changes or declines in consumer demand, or delays in nonessential services, due to general economic conditions, changes in preferences, or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences, and our key partners' respective abilities to adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. further, retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand. these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence, as well as levels of discretionary personal income, credit availability and interest rates. in addition, in recent periods fuel prices have been unstable and have reached historically high levels. if gasoline prices become unstable, this could cause a reduction in automobile purchases and a further shift in buying patterns from less fuel-efficient luxury or suv models (which typically provide higher profit margins to automotive retailers) to smaller, more fuel-efficient and economical vehicles (which typically have lower profit margins). a shift in preferences by consumers to smaller, more economical vehicles due to pricing, fuel costs or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.       while a decline in vehicle purchases in some instances creates additional demand for parts and services due to the aging of and increased wear and tear on existing vehicles, in difficult economic conditions, people often delay nonessential service and repairs on their vehicles. continued delays on the service and repairs of vehicles due to a continual decline in economic 13 table of contents conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and results of operations of our parts and service business, which has traditionally produced higher profit margins for our business relative to vehicle sales. conversely, in the recent past, we have seen the prices of used vehicles generally increase, creating an increased demand for new vehicles. a relative increase in new vehicle sales versus used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as used vehicle sales have traditionally produced relatively higher profit margins than new vehicle sales for our business. if our brand mix is significantly concentrated, and the manufacturer of one or more of those brands experiences any disruptions in its operations or a decrease in consumer demand for its vehicles, or otherwise develops a poor reputation, there could be a material adverse effect on our revenues, operational results or profitability. although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand, we have focused and continue to focus our new vehicle sales operations primarily on mid-line import and luxury brands, and there can be no assurance that our brand mix is appropriate or sufficiently diverse to protect from a significant decline in the desirability of vehicles manufactured by a particular manufacturer. at december 31, 2013, our brand mix was weighted 86% towards luxury and mid-line import brands, with the remaining 14% consisting of domestic brands. for the year ended december 31, 2013, brands representing 5% or more of our revenues from new vehicle sales were as follows:  brand % of total new vehicle revenues honda 20 % nissan 13 % toyota 11 % bmw 9 % ford 7 % mercedes-benz 7 % lexus 7 % acura 5 % if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or develops a reputation for producing undesirable vehicles, and we own dealerships that sell that manufacturer’s vehicles, our revenues at those dealerships could be adversely affected as consumers shift their vehicle purchases away from that brand. likewise, if the manufacturer experiences any disruption in its ability to produce vehicles, thus limiting the supply of vehicles to our dealerships, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and profitability. if the profitability at certain of our dealerships is adversely affected, there could be a significant reduction of our cash flows, which in turn could result in impairments of such dealership's properties and/or intangible assets.   despite our current level of outstanding indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. our existing, and future, debt may limit our flexibility to manage our business. furthermore, we must generate sufficient cash to service our debt, or our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. we and our subsidiaries may have the ability to incur substantial additional debt in the future to finance, among other things, acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and new and used vehicle inventory, as well as to refinance new and used vehicle inventory, subject in each case to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments and other agreements existing at the time such indebtedness is incurred. the specific restrictions that could potentially limit the additional amount of debt we could incur are the leverage covenants contained in various of our debt agreements. our debt service obligations could have important consequences to us for the foreseeable future, including the following: • our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;   • a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other corporate purposes;   • some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to certain risks of interest rate increases; and   • we may be or become substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and governmental regulations. 14 table of contents as a result of the foregoing and other potential limitations, our indebtedness obligations may limit our ability to take strategic actions that would otherwise enable us to manage our business, in a manner in which we otherwise would, absent such limitations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on our operating subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash and distribute cash to us to service our indebtedness and fund our ongoing operations. our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and fund our ongoing operations depends on our operating subsidiaries' ability to generate cash in the future and distribute that cash to us. it is possible that our subsidiaries may not generate cash from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. in addition, many of our subsidiaries are required to comply with the provisions of franchise agreements, dealer agreements, other agreements with manufacturers, mortgages, and credit facility providers. many of these agreements contain minimum working capital or net worth requirements, and are subject to change at least annually. although the requirements contained in these agreements did not restrict our subsidiaries from distributing cash to us as of december 31, 2013, unexpected changes to our franchise agreements, dealer agreements or other agreements with manufacturers could require us to alter the manner in which we distribute or use cash. if our operating subsidiaries are unable to generate and distribute sufficient cash to us to service our indebtedness and fund our ongoing operations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.    under several of our debt, mortgage, lease and framework agreements, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants. our failure to comply with certain covenants in these agreements could adversely affect our ability to access our borrowing capacity, subject us to acceleration of our outstanding debt or result in a cross default on other indebtedness, and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. there are operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt and mortgage agreements, including the agreement governing our senior credit facility, the indenture governing our senior notes and our mortgage agreements and related mortgage guarantees, as well as certain other agreements to which we are a party that may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue certain business activities. these limit, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional debt, create certain liens or other encumbrances, and make certain payments (including dividends and repurchases of our common stock and for investments). certain of these agreements also require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. in many cases, our compliance with these restrictions and covenants is tested giving pro forma effect to certain proposed transactions. if we are unable to comply with any applicable financial or other covenants after giving effect to certain proposed transactions or otherwise, we may not be able to complete such proposed transactions or may be required to seek waivers of or modifications to our covenants from our creditors, or we may need to undertake one or more transactions designed to generate proceeds sufficient to repay our debt. obtaining such waivers or modifications often requires the payment to creditors of significant fees and requires significant time and attention of management. we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any necessary actions at times, or on terms acceptable to us. our failure to comply with any of these covenants in the future could constitute a default under the relevant agreement, which could, depending on the relevant agreement, (i) entitle the creditors under such agreement to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreement and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings; (ii) require us to repay these borrowings; (iii) entitle the creditors under such agreement to foreclose on the property securing the relevant indebtedness; or (iv) prevent us from making debt service payments on certain of our other indebtedness, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in many cases, a default under one of our debt, mortgage, or other agreements could trigger cross default provisions in one or more of our other debt or mortgage agreements. in addition to the financial and other covenants contained in our various debt or mortgage agreements, a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease. certain of the leases governing such properties have certain covenants with which we must comply. if we fail to comply with the covenants under our leases, the respective landlords could, among exercising other remedies, terminate the leases and seek significant cash damages, or evict us from the applicable properties. similarly, our failure to comply with any financial or other covenants in any of our framework agreements would give the relevant manufacturer certain rights, including the right to reject proposed acquisitions, and may give it the right to repurchase its franchises from us. events that give rise to such rights, and our inability to acquire additional dealerships or the requirement that we sell one or more of our dealerships at any time, could inhibit the growth of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 table of contents manufacturers may also have the right to restrict our ability to provide guaranties of our operating companies, pledges of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and liens on our assets, which could materially adversely impact our ability to obtain financing for our business and operations on favorable terms or at desired levels, if at all. a decline in our credit rating or a general disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact our liquidity and ability to conduct our operations. access to sources of credit enhances our ability to take strategic actions for the benefit of our business. a deterioration of our credit rating, or a general disruption in the credit markets, could limit our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms. in addition, in the recent past, global financial markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile, and continue to be uncertain. these issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of certain credit risks and continued uncertain economic conditions in certain industries and sectors may make it more difficult for us to obtain funding at any given time. our inability to access necessary or desirable funding, or to enter into certain related transactions, at times and at costs deemed appropriate by us, could have a negative impact on our liquidity and our ability to conduct our operations. we currently maintain a senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks, and we have hedge transactions in place with a number of counterparties that we believe are financially stable. however, if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us or have entered into hedge or similar transactions with us are adversely affected by continued uncertain conditions in the u.s. and international capital markets, they may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations to us, which also could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to conduct our operations. our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates. we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory, have the ability to finance the purchases of used vehicle inventory and have the availability to borrow funds for working capital using senior secured credit facilities under which we are charged interest at variable rates. therefore, our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates. in addition, a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business, particularly new and used vehicle sales, because most of our customers finance their vehicle purchases. as a result, rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our capital costs and reducing our revenues. given our debt composition as of december 31, 2013, each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense, including floor plan interest, by as much as $6.1 million. when considered in connection with reduced expected sales as and if interest rates increase, any such increase could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers of the vehicles that we sell may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.        our ability to successfully market vehicles to the public depends to a great extent on aspects of manufacturers’ operations. vehicle manufacturers have in the recent past been adversely affected by the u.s. and international economic climate. in addition to challenges created by uncertain economic conditions, we remain vulnerable to other matters that may impact the manufacturers of the vehicles we sell. for example, other factors outside of our control that could negatively affect vehicle manufacturers include:   • changes in their respective financial condition;   • changes in their respective marketing efforts;   • changes in their respective reputation for quality;   • manufacturer and other product defects, including recalls;   • changes in their respective management;   • disruptions in the production and delivery of vehicles and parts due to natural disasters or other reasons that are outside of our control; and   • issues with respect to labor relations. adverse conditions that materially affect a vehicle manufacturer and impact its ability to profitably design, market, produce or distribute desirable new vehicles could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to (i) sell vehicles produced by that manufacturer, (ii) obtain or finance our desired new vehicle inventories, (iii) access or benefit from manufacturer financial 16 table of contents assistance programs, (iv) collect in full or on a timely basis any amounts due therefrom, and/or (v) obtain other goods and services provided by the impacted manufacturer. our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of any event that has an adverse effect on any vehicle manufacturers or distributors. in addition, if a vehicle manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy or similar proceedings, (i) the manufacturer could seek to terminate or reject all or certain of our franchises, (ii) if the manufacturer is successful in terminating all or certain of our franchises, we may not receive adequate compensation for those franchises, (iii) our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory may increase or no longer be available from such manufacturer’s captive finance subsidiary, (iv) consumer demand for such manufacturer’s products could be materially adversely affected, especially if costs related to improving such manufacturer’s financial condition are imputed to the price of its products, (v) there may be a significant disruption in the availability of consumer credit to purchase or lease vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing, which may negatively impact our sales, or (vi) there may be a reduction in the value of receivables and inventory associated with that manufacturer, among other things. the occurrence of any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. if vehicle manufacturers reduce or discontinue sales incentive, warranty or other promotional programs, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. we benefit from certain sales incentive, warranty and other promotional programs of vehicle manufacturers that are intended to promote and support their respective new vehicle sales. key incentive programs include:   • customer rebates on new vehicles;   • dealer incentives on new vehicles;   • special financing or leasing terms;   • warranties on new and used vehicles; and   • sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers. manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year. any reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers’ incentive programs for any reason, including a supply and demand imbalance, may reduce our sales volume which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our vehicle sales, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by depressed levels of available consumer financing. the majority of vehicle purchases are financed. during and as a result of the recent global economic downturn, consumers experienced a decline in the availability of credit. in addition, manufacturers decreased the availability of leases or, in some instances, terminated leasing programs altogether. the reduced availability of credit to consumers contributed to the decline in our vehicle sales in past periods. reductions in available credit or increased costs of credit could result in a decline in our vehicle sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. sub-prime lenders have historically provided financing to those buyers who, for various reasons, do not have access to traditional financing, including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle. during the recent economic downturn, sub-prime lenders became more stringent with their credit standards, which made it more difficult for consumers needing sub-prime financing to obtain credit in these periods. if this trend returns, or if interest rates increase, the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles again could become limited, resulting in a decline in our vehicle sales, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our business may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in one or more of our local markets, even if those conditions are not prominent nationally. our overall corporate results are also subject to local economic, competitive and other conditions prevailing in the various geographic markets in which we operate. our dealerships are currently located in the atlanta, austin, charlottesville, dallas-fort worth, durham, fayetteville, fort pierce, greensboro, greenville, houston, jackson, jacksonville, little rock, orlando, princeton, richmond, st. louis and tampa markets.  if economic conditions remain uncertain, we experience a decline in the value of our local brands for any reason, consumer vehicle demand decreases or competition for services offered by automotive retailers remains significant in any of these markets, or any of these factors becomes exacerbated, our business could be materially adversely affected. 17 table of contents if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on acceptable terms, if certain of our franchises are terminated, if certain manufacturers’ rights under their agreements with us are triggered, or if the geographic areas of any of our franchises are altered, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer (or manufacturer-authorized distributor) of each new vehicle brand it carries and/or is authorized to service, and we operate under additional framework agreements with some vehicle manufacturers, which contain additional requirements that govern the particular vehicle manufacturer’s franchises. our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers, service vehicles, sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers’ trademarks only to the extent permitted under these agreements. as a result of the terms of our dealer, framework and related agreements and our dependence on the rights granted by the manufacturers, the manufacturers have the right to exercise a great deal of control over our day-to-day operations, and the terms of these agreements govern key aspects of our operations, acquisition strategy and capital spending. our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed by manufacturers for a number of reasons, and many of the manufacturers have the right to direct us to divest our dealerships if there is a default under the franchise agreement, an unapproved change of control (including certain material changes in the composition of our board of directors during a specified time period, the acquisition of 20% or more of our voting stock by another vehicle manufacturer or distributor, or the acquisition of 50% or more of our voting stock by a person, entity or group not affiliated with the vehicle manufacturer or distributor), or certain other unapproved events (including certain extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets).   our dealer agreements are scheduled to expire at various times. although we expect that these agreements will be renewed in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these agreements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms or at all. most of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with a right of first refusal to purchase any of the manufacturer’s franchises we seek to sell. our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected to the extent that our rights become compromised or our operations are restricted due to the terms of our dealer or framework agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant percentage of our revenues. our dealer agreements do not give us the exclusive right to a given geographic area. manufacturers can establish new franchises or relocate existing franchises, subject to applicable state franchise laws. the establishment or relocation of franchises in our markets could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our dealerships in the market in which the action is taken. our failure to meet consumer satisfaction, financial or sales performance or facilities requirements specified by manufacturers may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability. many manufacturers attempt to measure customers’ satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indices (“csi”). the use of csi ratings by manufacturers is in addition to their contractual rights to monitor the financial and sales performance of our dealerships. at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealer or framework agreement, manufacturers will often establish sales or performance criteria for that dealership. in accordance with the terms of these agreements, these criteria have been modified by various manufacturers in the past, and we cannot assure you that they will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future. some of our dealerships have had difficulty meeting these criteria in the past. we cannot assure you that any of our dealerships will be able to comply with these criteria in the future. also, manufacturers often impose facilities requirements on our dealerships. among other things, manufacturers may require us to move or renovate our dealerships to meet certain image standards. image standards have been modified by manufacturers in the past, and we cannot assure you that the standards will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future. these commitments could require significant capital expenditures, which could have an adverse affect on our profitability. in accordance with the terms of an applicable framework agreement, a manufacturer may use these criteria as factors in evaluating any application we may make for acquisitions of additional dealerships. a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance criteria. this would impede our ability to execute acquisitions and limit our ability to grow. in addition, we receive payments and incentives from certain manufacturers based, in part, on our csi ratings, and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi ratings do not meet stated criteria. 18 table of contents manufacturers’ actions in connection with any proposed acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire dealerships selling a manufacturer’s automobiles. in addition, as described above, many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain csi rating and sales performance criteria as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions. we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these performance criteria at any applicable time or that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions, which may prevent us from being able to take advantage of strategic opportunities, and may limit our ability to expand our business. the process of obtaining a manufacturer's consent can take a significant amount of time. delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe would produce acquisition synergies and integrate well into our overall strategy. in addition, manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case-by-case basis. as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition, a manufacturer may require us to remodel or upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose to fund, causing us to divert our financial resources away from uses that management believes may be of higher long-term value to us. furthermore, the exercise by a manufacturer of its right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we otherwise would acquire, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow through acquisitions, and therefore materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. likewise, from time to time, we may determine that it is in our best interest to divest one or more of our dealerships. parties that are interested in acquiring any dealership may also be required to obtain the consent of the manufacturer. the refusal by the manufacturer to approve a potential buyer may delay the sale of that dealership, and would require us to find another potential buyer or wait until the buyer is able to meet the requirements of the manufacturer. a delay in the sale of a dealership could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. additionally, many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own. certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales that may be maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national, regional or local basis, as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets. if we reach any of these limits, we may be prevented from making further acquisitions, which could adversely affect our future growth. if state laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed, weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers, our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, non-renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements. applicable state laws generally provide that an automobile manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth “good cause” and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow them to attempt to comply with the manufacturer’s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or non-renewal. our framework agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that, among other things, attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under these laws, and, though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers' ongoing lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of these laws. if these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. without the protection of these state laws, it may also be more difficult for us to renew our dealer agreements upon expiration. changes in laws that provide manufacturers the ability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy, courts have held that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede the state laws that protect automotive retailers resulting in either the termination, non-renewal or rejection of franchises by such manufacturers, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. manufacturers’ restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises, which may have a number of impacts on us, including adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations, or even deterring an acquisition of us. some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or, in some cases, its parent, without the applicable manufacturer’s consent. our agreements with some manufacturers provide that, under certain circumstances, the manufacturer would have the right to terminate our agreement or force a sale of our franchise if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified percentage of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer. triggers of these clauses are often based upon actions by our stockholders and are generally outside of our control, and may result in the termination or non-renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more 19 table of contents franchises, which may have a material adverse effect on us. these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and, therefore, may adversely impact the value of our common stock. our business is seasonal, and events occurring during seasons in which revenues are typically higher may disproportionately affect our results of operations and financial condition. the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues. demand for vehicles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year. accordingly, we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of any year. if conditions occur during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales, such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate, war, high fuel costs, depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions, our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected. our business may be materially adversely affected by import product restrictions, foreign trade risks and currency valuations that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably. a portion of our business involves the sale of vehicles, parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states. as a result, our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise, including import duties, exchange rates, trade restrictions, work stoppages, natural or man-made disasters, and general political and socio-economic conditions in other countries. the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing quotas, duties or tariffs, which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and/or parts at reasonable prices. relative weakness of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies in the future may result in an increase in costs to us and in the retail price of such vehicles or parts, which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles and adversely impact our profitability. if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships, we may be unable to realize desired results and be required to divert resources from comparatively more profitable operations. we believe that the automotive retailing industry is a mature industry whose sales are significantly impacted by the prevailing economic climate, both nationally and in local markets. accordingly, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion, control costs in our operations and acquire and effectively and efficiently integrate acquired dealerships into our organization. when seeking to acquire and acquiring other dealerships, we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions. these risks include, but are not limited to:   • failing to obtain manufacturers’ consents to acquisitions of additional franchises;   • incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions;   • incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses;   • failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships and impairing relationships with employees;   • incorrectly valuing entities to be acquired or incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships;   • disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources to newly acquired dealerships; • failing to achieve predicted performance levels; and   • impairing relationships with manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management. we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel, procedures and structures, including our financial and reporting control systems, data processing systems and management structure. moreover, our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risks associated with integrating the acquired dealership. if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands, we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable. there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships, and we may not be able to grow our business through acquisitions if attractive targets are not available or if market values result in prices at levels that we do not believe offer an acceptable rate of return. we believe that the u.s. automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates. however, we often compete with several other national, regional and local dealership groups, and other strategic and financial buyers, some of which may have greater financial resources, in evaluating potential acquisition candidates. competition for 20 table of contents attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, and increased acquisition costs. we may have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate any such acquisitions on acceptable terms. substantial competition in automobile sales and services may materially adversely affect our profitability. the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and selection. our competition includes:   • franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles;   • privately negotiated sales of used vehicles;   • other used vehicle retailers, including regional and national vehicle rental companies;   • internet-based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers;   • service center and parts supply chain stores; and   • independent service and repair shops. we do not have any cost advantage over other retailers in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers. we typically rely on our advertising, merchandising, sales expertise, service reputation, strong local branding and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles. further, our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer’s product within a given geographic area. our revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or additional franchises are awarded in our markets in ways that negatively impact our sales. property loss or other uninsured liabilities at some of our dealerships could impact our financial condition and results of operations. the automotive retail business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property at dealership locations, including vehicles and parts. we have historically experienced business interruptions from time to time at several of our dealerships due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events, such as hurricanes in florida and tornadoes and hail storms in texas and mississippi. concentration of property at dealership locations also makes the automotive retail business particularly vulnerable to theft, fraud and misappropriation of assets. illegal or unethical conduct by employees, customers, vendors and unaffiliated third parties can result in loss of assets, disrupt operations, impact brand reputation, jeopardize manufacturer and other relationships, result in the imposition of fines or penalties, and subject us to governmental investigations or lawsuits. other potential liabilities arising out of our operations may involve claims by employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements. to the extent we experience events such as these, or others, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted. while we maintain insurance to protect against a number of losses, this insurance coverage often contains significant deductibles which we must pay prior to obtaining insurance coverage. in addition, we “self-insure” a portion of our potential liabilities, meaning we do not carry insurance from a third party for such liabilities, and are wholly responsible for any related losses including for certain potential liabilities that some states prohibit the maintenance of insurance to protect against. in certain instances, our insurance may not fully cover a loss depending on the applicable deductible or the magnitude and nature of the claim. additionally, changes in the cost or availability of insurance in the future could substantially increase our costs to maintain our current level of coverage or could cause us to reduce our insurance coverage and increase our self-insured risks. to the extent we incur significant additional costs for insurance, suffer losses that are not covered by in-force insurance or suffer losses for which we are self-insured, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. business interruptions at our dealerships due to a failure of any of our management information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. we rely on management information systems at our dealerships which are licensed from third parties and are used in all aspects of our sales and service efforts, as well as in the preparation of our consolidated financial and operating data. all of our dealerships currently operate on a common dealer management system (“dms”) provided by adp. our business could be significantly disrupted if (i) the adp dms fails to integrate with other third party management information systems, customer relations management tools or other software, or to the extent any of these systems become unavailable to us for an extended period of time, or (ii) if our relationship deteriorates with adp or any of our other third-party providers. any such significant 21 table of contents disruption in our business could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. government regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our business. we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including local licensing requirements. these laws regulate the conduct of our business, including:   • motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices;   • leasing;   • sales of finance, insurance and vehicle protection products;   • consumer credit;   • unfair and deceptive trade practices;   • consumer protection;   • consumer privacy;   • money laundering;   • advertising;   • land use and zoning; • environmental matters;   • health and safety; and   • employment practices.     in every state in which we operate, we must obtain certain licenses issued by state authorities in order to operate our businesses, including dealer, sales, finance and insurance-related licenses. state laws also regulate our conduct of business, including our advertising, operating, financing, employment and sales practices. other laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used automobile dealers. the enactment of new laws and regulations that materially impair or restrict our sales, finance and insurance, or other operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. in addition, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, which was signed into law on july 21, 2010, established the consumer financial protection bureau, which has broad regulatory powers. although automotive dealers are generally excluded from coverage within this agency, the dodd-frank act and future regulatory actions by this bureau could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions.     our financing activities are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, insurance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws and regulations. some states regulate finance, documentation and administrative fees that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales. claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our dealerships by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines. in recent years, private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the united states have increased their scrutiny of advertising, sales, and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles. these activities have led many lenders to limit the amounts that may be charged to customers as fee income for these activities. if these or similar activities were to significantly restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers, we could be adversely affected.     our operations are also subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act, the magnusson-moss warranty act, federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the united states department of transportation and various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. the imported automobiles we purchase are subject to u.s. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business, we may, from time to time, be subject to claims for duties, penalties, liquidated damages, or other charges.       if we or any of our employees at any individual dealership violate or are alleged to violate laws and regulations applicable to them or protecting consumers generally, we could be subject to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions and adverse publicity. such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages 22 table of contents and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations.            likewise, employees and former employees are protected by a variety of employment-related laws and regulations relating to, among other things, wages and discrimination. allegations of a violation could subject us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative investigations or adverse publicity. such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and civil fines and penalties, and damage our reputation and sales. environmental laws and regulations govern, among other things, discharges into the air and water, storage of petroleum substances and chemicals, the handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases. in addition, we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment and/or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes. these federal and state statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination. similar to many of our competitors, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such federal and state statutes. in addition, we may be subject to broad liabilities arising out of contamination at our currently and formerly owned or operated facilities, at locations to which hazardous substances were transported from such facilities, and at such locations related to entities formerly affiliated with us. although for some such potential liabilities we believe we are entitled to indemnification from other entities, we cannot assure you that such entities will view their obligations as we do or will be able or willing to satisfy them. failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or significant additional expenditures required to maintain compliance therewith, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. a significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant license or permit or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects. we further expect that, from time to time, new laws and regulations, particularly in the labor, employment, environmental and consumer protection areas will be enacted, and compliance with such laws, or penalties for failure to comply, could significantly increase our costs. any further healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition. rising healthcare costs and interest in universal healthcare coverage in the united states have resulted in significant healthcare reforms in recent years. we cannot predict the extent of the effect that any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on us. however, any further expansion in government’s role in the u.s. healthcare industry could result in significant additional long-term costs to us, which could in turn adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition. a data security breach with regard to personally identifiable information ("pii") about our customers or employees could negatively affect operations and result in high costs. in the ordinary course of business, we and our partners receive significant pii about our customers in order to complete the sale or service of a vehicle and related products. we also receive pii from our employees. numerous state and federal regulations, as well as payment card industry and other vendor standards, govern the collection and maintenance of pii from consumers and other individuals. although many companies across many industries are affected by malicious efforts to obtain access to pii, news reports suggest that the automotive dealership industry is a particular target of identity thieves. moreover, there are numerous opportunities for a data security breach, including cyber-security breaches, burglary, lost or misplaced data, scams, or misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement or adopt in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, scams, burglary, human errors, acts of vandalism, or other events. alleged or actual data security breaches can increase costs of doing business, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to negative publicity, individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. governmental regulation pertaining to fuel economy standards may affect a manufacturer’s ability to produce cost effective vehicles, which could impact our sales. the energy policy conservation act, enacted into law by congress in 1975, added title v, “improving automotive efficiency,” to the motor vehicle information and cost savings act and established corporate average fuel economy (“cafe”) standards for passenger cars and light trucks. cafe is the sales weighted average fuel economy, expressed in miles per gallon (mpg) of a manufacturer’s fleet of passenger cars or light trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less, manufactured for sale in the u.s., for any given model year. 23 table of contents the primary goal of cafe was to substantially increase passenger car fuel efficiency. congress has continuously increased the standards since 1974 and, since mid-year 1990, the passenger car standard was increased to 27.5 miles per gallon, a level at which it remained through 2009. passenger car fuel economy is now required to rise to an industry average of 39 miles per gallon by 2016. likewise, significant changes to light truck cafe standards have been established over the years. the standard is expected to be increased to about 30 miles per gallon by 2016. the penalty for a manufacturer’s failure to meet the cafe standards is currently $5.50 per tenth of a mile per gallon for each tenth under the target volume times the total volume of those vehicles manufactured for a given model year. in may 2010, the u.s. environmental protection agency (the “epa”) and the department of transportation's national highway traffic safety administration (the “nhtsa”) issued final rules establishing new standards for light-duty vehicles aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel economy. under the joint final rule, the epa finalized greenhouse gas emissions standards under the clean air act, and the nhtsa finalized cafe standards under the energy policy and conservation act, as amended. these standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, in model years 2017 through 2025. failure of a manufacturer to develop passenger vehicles and light trucks that meet cafe standards could subject the manufacturer to substantial penalties, increase the cost of vehicles sold to us, and adversely affect our ability to market and sell vehicles to meet consumer needs and desires. furthermore, congress may continue to increase cafe standards in the future and such additional legislation may have a further adverse impact on vehicle manufacturers and our business. climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles we sell. the u.s. environmental protection agency (“epa”) has published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the epa, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act. accordingly, the epa has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. the epa’s proposed regulations requiring permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources is currently under review at the supreme court of the united states. the outcome of that review is uncertain. in addition, on october 30, 2009, the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states, including facilities that emit more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases on an annual basis, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi−state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to require reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases. the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our facilities, equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. in addition, similar regulations imposed on the owners of the vehicles that we sell could adversely affect demand for certain vehicles. the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business. our success depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued contributions of our management team. manufacturer dealer or framework agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers or other management positions. the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the profitability of our operations, or may result in a violation of an applicable dealer or framework agreement. in addition, we may need to hire additional managers or other key personnel from time to time. in some instances, potential acquisitions are more viable to us if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manager of an acquired dealership not continue to manage the business. the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate, particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel, is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment. the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by us or the manufacturers. we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel. although our ceo and coo have entered into agreements relating to their employment with us, most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements, and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time. further, we do not maintain “key man” life 24 table of contents insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel. if we are unable to retain our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we are, and will continue to be, subject to legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. we are involved and will continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with customers, employment-related lawsuits, class actions, purported class actions, and actions brought by governmental authorities. we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. however, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. item 1b. unresolved
