item 1a. risk factors – “our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities”. mergers and acquisitions. we actively seek to expand and enhance our business through strategic acquisitions.  we may seek to acquire andas and ndas from other pharma companies, or pursue acquisition of independent businesses that we believe complement our existing business and provide us opportunities for growth.  during 2011 and early 2012, we completed three significant acquisitions.   on may 3, 2011, we acquired avr business trust and its subsidiaries, advanced vision research, inc. and advanced vision pharmaceuticals, llc (collectively, "avr") for $26.0 million in cash.  avr is a developer and marketer of a line of otc eye care products marketed primarily under the theratears® brand name.  their products are carried by major drug retailers throughout the united states, as well as being marketed in various foreign countries.   on december 22, 2011, we acquired three ndas from h. lundbeck a/s (“lundbeck”). on the date of closing, akorn made an initial payment of $45 million and will likely owe a subsequent milestone payment of $15 million in cash on the third anniversary of the closing date.  the initial purchase price and the subsequent milestone payment are subject to a reduction if certain sales targets are not met in the first three years and the subsequent three years post closing. the acquired portfolio consists of nembutal®, a schedule ii controlled drug, diuril® and cogentin®. in addition, we signed a transition services agreement with lundbeck to ensure product availability, and separately paid approximately $4.6 million for lundbeck’s existing inventory of the three acquired products.  this acquisition provided us with three branded, hospital injectables to add to our portfolio.     5     on february 28, 2012, subsequent to the end of our 2011 fiscal year, we closed on our acquisition of selected assets of kilitch drugs (india) limited (“kilitch”).  the acquisition was pursuant to a business transfer agreement (“bta”) between our subsidiary, akorn india private limited, and kilitch signed on october 6, 2011.  we paid $59.9 million in cash at closing, which includes $1.8 million in transaction-related taxes and duties, and may owe additional consideration of approximately $4.0 million.  the primary assets acquired were kilitch’s pharmaceutical manufacturing complex in paonta sahib, himachal pradesh, india and its ongoing book of business.  also acquired pursuant to the bta were selected assets of nbz pharma limited, a company affiliated with kilitch, from which the company acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute certain pharmaceuticals products.  the paonta sahib plant currently manufactures pharmaceutical products primarily for contract customers in india and for export to unregulated markets.  the company’s plan is for this manufacturing plant to obtain fda and other international certification so that it can manufacture product for export to the u.s. and other regulated markets. business development.  in additional to our internal research and development, we also maintain a business development program that identifies potential product acquisition or product licensing opportunities. we have strategically focused our business development efforts on products that complement our existing product lines and are expected to have few competitors. in 2004, we entered into a 50/50 strategic partnership with strides arcolab limited (“strides”) in a new company named akorn-strides llc (the “joint venture company”) for the development and marketing of a number of injectable anda products for the hospital and alternate site markets in the united states.  each partner funded the joint venture company with $1,500,000 for initial development projects. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note p – “business alliances” for more information.  strides was responsible for developing, manufacturing and supplying the injectable products, while akorn was responsible for sales and marketing of these products within the united states.  the joint venture company launched its first products in the second half of 2008.  to supplement strides’ manufacturing capabilities, during 2010 akorn began manufacturing one joint venture company product in our decatur, illinois plant.  the joint venture company product pipeline was limited to those products identified at the founding of the joint venture company and placed into development shortly thereafter.  for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the joint venture company generated net sales of $6.4 million, $16.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively.   on december 29, 2010, the joint venture company entered into a purchase agreement with pfizer, inc. (“pfizer”) to sell all of its andas to pfizer for a purchase price of $63.2 million (the “pfizer sale agreement”).  ownership of dormant products and those in development transferred as of the purchase date, while ownership of the actively-marketed andas transferred in the second quarter of 2011.  pursuant to the terms of the pfizer sale agreement, the joint venture company was allowed to sell its actively-marketed anda products through april 30, 2011.  subsequent agreement between the parties allowed for the continued sale of one product into june 2011.  we recognized $34.9 million in pre-tax income related to the pfizer sale agreement, of which $21.5 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $13.4 million was recognized in the second quarter of 2011.     6     on march 22, 2007, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement (the “mbl distribution agreement”) with massachusetts biological laboratories of the university of massachusetts (“mbl”) for distribution of td vaccines.  mbl manufactured the td vaccine products and we marketed and distributed them on an exclusive basis in the united states and puerto rico.  in july 2008, the mbl distribution agreement was amended to: (i) allow us to destroy our remaining inventory of td vaccine, 15 dose/vial, in exchange for receiving an equivalent number of doses of preservative-free td vaccine, single-dose/vial (the "single-dose product") at no additional cost other than destruction and documentation expenses; (ii) reduce the aggregate purchase price of the single-dose product during the first year of the mbl distribution agreement by approximately 14.4%; (iii) reduce our purchase commitment for the second year of the mbl distribution agreement by approximately 34.7%; and (iv) reduce our purchase commitment for the third year of the mbl distribution agreement by approximately 39.5%. we were unable to make a payment of approximately $3.4 million for td vaccine products that was due to mbl by february 27, 2009 under our mbl distribution agreement.  while we made a partial payment of $1.0 million to mbl on march 13, 2009, we were also unable to make another payment of approximately $3,375,000 due to mbl on march 28, 2009.  accordingly, we entered into a letter agreement with mbl on march 27, 2009 ("mbl letter agreement"), pursuant to which we agreed to pay mbl the $5.8 million remaining due for these td vaccine products plus an additional $4.8 million in consideration of the amendments to the mbl distribution agreement payable according to a periodic payment schedule through june 30, 2010.  in addition, pursuant to the mbl letter agreement, the mbl distribution agreement was converted to a non-exclusive agreement, we provided mbl a standby letter of credit to secure our obligation to pay amounts due to mbl, and we were released from our obligation to further purchase td vaccine products from mbl upon providing mbl with such letter of credit.   pursuant to the mbl letter agreement, mbl agreed not to declare a breach or otherwise act to terminate the mbl distribution agreement provided that we comply with the terms of the mbl letter agreement, the mbl distribution agreement (as amended by the mbl letter agreement) and any agreements required to be entered into pursuant to the mbl letter agreement. we made all scheduled payments to mbl during 2009 and 2010 in accordance with the mbl letter agreement and sold all existing td inventory by december 31, 2009.  we subsequently agreed to a limited sale of td vaccine in the first quarter of 2010.  however, we were not able to reach a long-term agreement with mbl regarding the business terms that would govern the purchase of new td inventory.  as a result, on december 14, 2009, mbl delivered to us a ninety-day notice of termination of the mbl distribution agreement, and accordingly, the mbl distribution agreement terminated on march 14, 2010.  upon the termination of this agreement, we exited the biologics & vaccines segment.   patents, trademarks and proprietary rights.  we consider the protection of our patents, trademarks and proprietary rights important to maintaining and growing our business.  through our acquisition in 2011, we have increased the number and importance of trademarks related to our products and product lines.  one of our acquired companies, avr, maintains a line of otc eye care products sold under trade names such as theratears® and sterilid®, among others.  we are committed to maintaining and defending the trade names of avr’s products, as they are important in supporting the success and growth of this business.  in addition, we maintain and defend trademarks related to a number of internally-developed products, as well as those acquired or licensed from other companies. we have sought, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the united states and selected foreign countries where deemed appropriate.  as of december 31, 2011, we had received two u.s. patents which expire in 2019 and had one additional u.s. patent application pending. the importance of these patents does not vary among our business segments. we also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to maintain and develop our competitive position. we enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees pursuant to which such employees agree to assign to us any inventions relating to our business made by them while in our employ. however, there can be no assurance that others may not acquire or independently develop similar technology or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, that we will be able to maintain information pertinent to such research as proprietary technology or trade secrets. see item 1a. risk factors — “our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes” for more information. employee relations. as of december 31, 2011, we had ­­­553 permanent, full-time employees and 11 part-time or temporary employees.  of our total full-time employees, 272 worked at our manufacturing facilities in decatur, illinois, 130 worked at our manufacturing facility in somerset, new jersey and the remaining 151 worked in corporate support functions, either at our corporate offices in lake forest, illinois, our r&d facility in skokie, illinois, our distribution facility in gurnee, illinois, or from other field-based locations. we believe we have good relations with our employees.  none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. competition. the marketing and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of the business. many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater sales volume, larger sales forces and greater manufacturing capacity. see item 1a. risk factors — “our industry is very competitive. additionally, changes in technology could render our products obsolete” for more information.     7     the companies that compete with our ophthalmic segment include allergan pharmaceuticals, inc., novartis, bausch & lomb, inc., apotex and sun pharmaceuticals, among others.  the ophthalmic segment competes primarily on the basis of price and service.   the companies that compete with our hospital drugs & injectables segment include both generic and name brand companies such as hospira, inc., teva pharmaceutical industries, pfizer, sagent, novartis, app, american regent, inc., hikma and bedford. the hospital drugs & injectables segment competes primarily on the basis of price. suppliers and customers.  no supplier represented 10% or more of our purchases in 2011.  in 2010 and 2009, purchases from mbl represented 14% and 38% of our purchases, respectively.  in 2010 and 2009, mbl was our sole supplier of td vaccine for our biologics & vaccines segment.   as discussed above, our mbl distribution agreement terminated on march 14, 2010 and we anticipate no future purchases of vaccine products from mbl.  aside from mbl, no other suppliers represented 10% or more of our purchases in 2010 or 2009.   we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. the principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. many of these components are available from only a single source and, in the case of many of our andas and ndas, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in 2011, 2010 and 2009, a high percentage of our sales were to the three large wholesale drug distributors noted below.  these three large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable in all our business segments except for contract services. the three distributors are: ● amerisourcebergen corporation (“amerisourcebergen”); ● cardinal health, inc. (“cardinal”); and ● mckesson drug company (“mckesson”). on a combined basis, these three wholesale drug distributors accounted for approximately 66% of our total gross sales and 63% of our net revenue in 2011, and 72% of our gross accounts receivable as of december 31, 2011. the difference between gross sales and net revenue is that gross sales is calculated before allowances for chargebacks, rebates, promotions and product returns (see item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — “critical accounting policies” for more information). the table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales, net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:     2011     2010     2009         gross sales     net revenue     gross accounts receivable     gross sales     net revenue     gross accounts receivable     gross sales     net revenue     gross accounts receivable   amerisourcebergen     23 %     23 %     29 %     24 %     17 %     32 %     25 %     21 %     44 % cardinal     27 %     25 %     34 %     25 %     17 %     31 %     21 %     19 %     21 % mckesson     16 %     15 %     9 %     15 %     11 %     7 %     16 %     14 %     6 % combined total     66 %     63 %     72 %     64 %     45 %     70 %     62 %     54 %     71 %     amerisourcebergen, cardinal and mckesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. none of these distributors is an end user of our products. if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. however, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them. a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. see item 1a risk factors – “we depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect” for more information.     8     backorders. as of december 31, 2011, we had approximately $2.9 million of products on backorder as compared to approximately $0.5 million of backorders as of december 31, 2010. we anticipate filling all current open backorders during 2012. government regulation. pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies, including the fda, the drug enforcement administration (“dea”), the federal trade commission (“ftc”) and other federal, state and local agencies. the federal food, drug and cosmetic act (the “fdc act”), the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market. the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices (“cgmp”) regulations, non-compliance with which can result in fines, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution. the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products. fda approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed. new drugs require the application filing of an nda, including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug. generic drugs, which are equivalents of existing, off-patent brand name drugs, require the application filing of an anda. an anda does not, for the most part, require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator. however, the anda must, for example, provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability. the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and, to a large extent, beyond our control.   we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and the dea.  throughout the five year period ended december 31, 2011, there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or review activities.  the most recent inspections conducted during june 2011 at our somerset, new jersey plant and august 2011 at our decatur, illinois plant, resulted in no significant observations.   product recalls. there were no recalls of any of our products during 2011, 2010 or 2009.  during 2009, we recorded a net provision for product recalls of $102,000 in relation to a recall of our cyanide antidote kits during 2008.  this recall was initiated when we were notified by the manufacturer of a syringe contained within the kit that the syringe was being recalled.  the recall of our cyanide antidote kits resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply in the marketplace. dea regulation. we also manufacture and distribute several controlled-drug substances, the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea. failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product.  there were no dea citations issued to us in 2011, 2010 or 2009. environment. we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.   foreign sales. during 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately $5.3 million, $1.1 million and $0.8 million of our net revenue, respectively, was related to sales to customers in foreign countries.  the increase in 2011 over the prior two years was due to a large order for one injectable akorn product, and international sales of theratears® products following our acquisition of avr in early may 2011.  our foreign sales are expected to increase as a result of the kilitch acquisition.     9     seasonality and other cyclical sales fluctuations. most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality.  we do market certain allergy products that typically generate higher sales volume in the warmer months, but these products do not materially impact our overall sales trends.  additionally, we market various antidote products through our hospital drugs & injectables segment, the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our ongoing customers.  the products we previously marketed through our biologics & vaccines segment were subject to seasonal fluctuations, with td vaccines sold in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products typically sold in the august through november period.  we discontinued distribution of flu vaccines during 2009 and ceased distribution of td vaccines as of march 14, 2010 upon the termination of our mbl distribution agreement. government contracts. none of our business segments is generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.   available information. we file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission (“sec”). materials filed with the sec can be read and copied at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.  information on the operation of the public reference room may be obtained by calling the sec at 1-800-sec-0330.  the sec maintains an internet web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec. our filings are available to the public at the website maintained by the sec, http://www.sec.gov. we also make available, free of charge, through our web site at www.akorn.com, our reports on forms 10-k, 10-q, and 8-k, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the sec.  the information contained on our web site is not a part of this document.     10     item 1a. risk factors.   we depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect. a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable. the following three wholesalers – amerisourcebergen, cardinal and mckesson – accounted for approximately 66% of total gross sales and 63% of total net revenues in 2011, and 72% of gross trade receivables as of december 31, 2011. in addition to acting as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies. the loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. a change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities. our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels. we may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting. our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure. there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or, if developed, successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays, which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. our failure to develop new products, to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines, prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities. federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business. the development, testing, manufacturing, processing, quality, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling, record keeping, distribution, storage and advertising of our products, and disposal of waste products arising from such activities, are subject to regulation by the fda, dea, ftc, the consumer product safety commission, the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency. similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities. noncompliance with applicable united states and/or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, penalties, mandatory recalls or seizures, suspensions of production, recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution. any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. new, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, if any, could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing methods, expanded or different labeling, the recall, replacement or discontinuation of certain products, additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation. such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. see item 1. business — “government regulation.” we are subject to regulation by the fda. all pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act. under the fdc act, the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations. this authority includes, but is not limited to, the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non-complying products, to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp, to recall products, to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators. other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications. any such enforcement activities, including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, product recalls may be issued at our discretion, or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products. recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or other reasons. no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future. any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, such actions, in certain circumstances, could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships.     11   we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission. the fda approval process is typically lengthy, and approval is never certain. our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations. we and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs. a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if the fda changes its regulatory position, it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products. fda interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies, industry trends, and/or prevailing scientific rationale.  if the fda changes its regulatory position due to such factors, it could result in our delay or suspension of the manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain of our products.  we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale. in addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. any change in the fda’s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. a limited number of products we market are non-application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda-issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the 1962 amendment of the fdc act. these products have routinely been disclosed to fda by akorn.  the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and/or challenge by the fda, which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing of such products, or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based. any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to extensive dea regulation, which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized. we also manufacture and sell drugs which are “controlled substances” as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws, which impose, among other things, certain licensing, security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies, as well as quotas for the manufacture, purchase and sale of controlled substances. the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market. see item 1. business – “dea regulation”. we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and may face difficulties in integrating them, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase costs and place a significant strain on our management.          if we fail to manage the integration of our domestic and international acquisitions and achieve expected synergies, our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted.  the operating success of both our domestic and international acquisitions involves the integration of products, processes and personnel into our existing model.  in addition, the integration of international acquisitions requires both establishing and training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely, and can involve cultural, monetary and systems challenges.  our personnel, systems, procedures, or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses.  if our newly-acquired businesses require a disproportionate share of our resources and management’s attention, our overall financial results may suffer.     12     we may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest on our outstanding convertible senior notes or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change.   in june 2011, we issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% convertible senior notes due 2016 (the “notes”).  the notes require us to make semi-annual coupon interest payments of $2.1 million on june 1 and december 1 of each year until the notes mature on june 1, 2016.  if we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our interest payment obligations when those obligations are due.  if a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes.  if we fail to repurchase the notes when required, we will be in default under the indenture that governs the notes. we may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business.   it is possible that we will require additional funds in order to materially grow our business. we require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and productivity improvement plans, continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing plants to increase capacity and support product development programs, meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, and run our normal business operations. we may seek additional funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. however, adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us.  without sufficient additional capital funding, we may be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and marketing initiatives, or operations. further, such additional financing, if obtained, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest.   we have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products. we have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products. since 2004, we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline. there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda-approved andas or ndas, or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit. in addition, any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business. availability under our credit agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements.        we are party to a revolving credit agreement with bank of america, n.a., (the “agent”) and other financial institutions (collectively with the agent, the “boa lenders”) through which we obtained a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the “boa credit facility”), which includes a $2.0 million letter of credit facility.  we may request expansion of the boa credit facility from time to time in increments of at least $5.0 million up to a maximum commitment of $35.0 million, so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  the facility matures in march 2016.  we may early terminate the boa lenders’ commitments under the boa credit facility upon 90 days’ notice to the agent at any time after the first year.   availability under the revolving credit line is equal to the lesser of (a) $20.0 million reduced by outstanding letter of credit obligations or (b) the amount of a borrowing base (as defined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement) determined by reference to the value of the borrowers’ eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and fixed assets as of the closing date and the end of each calendar month thereafter.  the boa credit agreement contains representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, limitations on:  distributions; additional borrowings and liens; additional investments and asset sales; and fundamental changes to corporate structure or organization documents.  the financial covenants require the borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 during any period commencing on the date that an event of default occurs or availability under the boa credit agreement is less than 15% of the aggregate boa lenders’ commitments under the boa credit agreement.  during the term of the agreement, we must provide the agent with monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, monthly compliance certificates, annual budget projections and copies of press releases and sec filings.  should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants, availability under the credit agreement could be restricted which would negatively impact our liquidity and may require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations or to fund growth opportunities. our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully utilize our existing cash reserves and operating cash flows to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify, acquire or develop, new product to market and distribute. we continue to seek growth opportunities, either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products. continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis, whether developed internally or by third party partners, or acquired from other companies.  any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, or acquire or develop, and market and distribute new products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business. our success depends on the development of generic and off-patent pharmaceutical products, which are particularly susceptible to competition, substitution policies and reimbursement policies. our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents, determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent, and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times. generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals. generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments, as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing. there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement. in addition, generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete, or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell. there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future. an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.     13     further, there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell. in addition, governmental and cost-containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products. we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through, among other things, creation of strong brand-name recognition and product-line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. we can be subject to legal proceedings against us, which may prove costly and time-consuming even if without merit. in the ordinary course of our business, we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies. to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future, this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future. in addition, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings, the consequences could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. see item 3. legal proceedings. our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties, which we cannot control.        we rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell.  currently, this risk is limited to a few akorn and avr products.  however, we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our two domestic manufacturing facilities.  if we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute such products as planned.  further, no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications.  any delays or difficulties with third-party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the chairman of our board of directors is subject to conflicts of interest, and through his stock ownership and position as chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies. john n. kapoor, ph.d., the chairman of our board of directors and a principal shareholder, is the president of ej financial enterprises, inc. (“ej financial”), a health care consulting investment company. ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields, and dr. kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies. the john n. kapoor trust dated 9/20/89 (the “kapoor trust”), the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr. kapoor, is a principal shareholder of each of these companies. as a result, dr. kapoor does not devote his full time to our business. although such companies do not currently compete directly with us, certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business. discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete.  potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. dr. kapoor owns, directly and indirectly, a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock.  as a result, dr. kapoor can strongly influence, and potentially control, the outcome of our corporate actions, including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control.  decisions made by dr. kapoor with respect to his and his related parties’ ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business.     14     we depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully.   our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers. the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, our performance depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of our key research and development personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. competition for such personnel is intense, particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel. we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future, and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, and on our results of operations and financial condition. the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non-prescription basis, which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products. from time to time, the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis, without a prescription. fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and, accordingly, reduce our profits. our industry is very competitive. additionally, changes in technology could render our products obsolete. we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours, in developing, acquiring, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases. further, other products now in use, under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies, may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products. the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete, and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can. competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner, and therefore, may begin to market their products in advance of ours. we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price, service and technical capabilities. there can be no assurance that: (i) we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products; (ii) additional competitors will not enter the market; (iii) our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products; or (iv) competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.    our general business strategy may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, a volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. if equity and credit market conditions prove unfavorable, we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing, or obtaining such financing may be more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. a prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement, pricing or sales levels, which would harm our operating results. there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times, which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans. there is also a possibility that our stock price may decline, due in part to the volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions.   we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims; we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result. the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products, or items within our products, may prove to be defective and cause a health risk. in that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. we have recalled products in the past and, based on this experience, believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us, potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm our ability to market our products. we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during 2008, due to the third quarter recall notification by bd, of their 60ml syringe.  this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us, to support the cyanide antidote kit.  our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall, and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace.  our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda, as part of our due diligence in apprising the fda of our reaction to the bd recall.  there were no product recalls in 2011, 2010 or 2009.     15     although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future. even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity, hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business. successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of $10,000,000 for aggregate annual claims with a $100,000 deductible per incident and a $500,000 aggregate annual deductible.  however, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims. additionally, there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source. we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline. further, in the case of many of our andas and ndas, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes. the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of much litigation. there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i) successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii) obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii) are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position. it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from. consequently, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. our inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, virtually all the drug products that we market are generics, with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached.  while this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain fda approval to market our generic products, it also allows competing drug companies to do the same.  should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market, our profit margins could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price. the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder’s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. we have registered shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements filed with the sec. sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline.     16     exercise of warrants and options, or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt, may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock. if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities, exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. as of december 31, 2011, holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive 16,591,751 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.13 per share. any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders. our earnings will be diluted if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price (currently $8.76 per share) on our convertible notes.  in addition, the notes become convertible if the closing trading price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 of the last 30 trading days of any calendar quarter through the remaining term of the notes.  if the notes become convertible and are surrendered for conversion, we have the option of satisfying all or a portion of our obligation in shares of our common stock, which could result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders. we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock. we are authorized to issue up to a total of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. if we issue additional shares of preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock. in particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. these terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business, and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock. we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations, which may increase the volatility of our stock price. our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products, the failure to develop such products, delays in obtaining government approvals, including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products, expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities, expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products, changes in our customer base, a customer’s termination of a substantial account, the availability and cost of raw materials, interruptions in supply by third-party manufacturers, seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in the sales of certain of our products, the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors, loss of key personnel, changes in the mix of products sold by us, changes in sales and marketing expenditures, competitive pricing pressures, expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period. such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock. the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management. as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the “exchange act”) and the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (the “sarbanes-oxley act”). these requirements are extensive. the exchange act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. the sarbanes-oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight is required. this may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. item 1b. unresolved
