item 1a. risk factors   if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose some or all of their investment.   risks related to our business   increases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cause our interest expense to increase, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect our profitability as well as the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   we invest primarily in rmbs, as well as other assets such as abs, cmbs and mortgage loans. in a normal yield curve environment, an investment in such assets will generally decline in value if long-term interest rates increase. declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us, which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   a significant risk associated with our target assets is the risk that both long-term and short-term interest rates will increase significantly. if long-term rates increase significantly, the market value of these investments will decline, and the duration and weighted average life of the investments will increase. we could realize losses if these investments were sold. at the same time, an increase in short-term interest rates will increase the amount of interest owed on the repurchase agreements we enter into to finance the purchase of our investments.   market values of our investments may decline without any general increase in interest rates for a number of reasons, such as increases or expected increases in defaults, or increases or expected increases in voluntary prepayments for those investments that are subject to prepayment risk or widening of credit spreads.   in addition, in a period of rising interest rates, our operating results will depend in large part on the difference between the income from our assets and financing costs. we anticipate that, in most cases, the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net income. increases in these rates will tend to decrease our net income and market value of our assets.   competition may limit the availability of desirable investments and result in reduced risk-adjusted returns.   our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to acquire our targeted investments at favorable prices. we compete with other mortgage reits, specialty finance companies, private funds, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, depository institutions, governmental bodies, governmental sponsored entities and other entities. these other entities increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are and have stronger balance sheets and access to greater capital and other resources than we have and may have other advantages over us. in addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. competition may result in fewer available investments, higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs. in addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives, including our objective to achieve positive financial results including specified levels of distributions to our stockholders. failure to accomplish any of the foregoing would materially and adversely affect us.   we may change our investment and operational policies without stockholder consent, which may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.   our board of directors determines our operational policies and may amend or revise such policies, including our policies with respect to our reit qualification, acquisitions, dispositions, operations, indebtedness and distributions, or approve transactions that deviate from these policies, without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. operational policy changes could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.     16   we may also change our investment strategies and policies and target asset classes at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different in type from, and possibly riskier than, its current assets or the investments contemplated in this report. a change in our investment strategies and policies and target asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.     we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.   our business is highly dependent on the communications and information systems of our manager. any failure or interruption of these systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.     17   risks related to u.s. government programs   the federal reserve’s recent announcement that it would reduce its monthly purchases pursuant to qe3 could impact the market for and value of the agency rmbs in which we invest as well as our net asset value and net interest margin.   on september 13, 2012, the federal reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing, or qe3, which is an open-ended program designed to expand the federal reserve’s holdings of long-term securities by purchasing an additional $40 billion of agency rmbs per month until key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, show signs of improvement. in december 2012, the federal reserve announced that it would begin buying $45 billion of long-term treasury bonds each month. on december 18, 2013, the federal reserve announced that it would reduce its purchases of agency rmbs by $5 billion per month and reduce its purchases of treasury bonds by $5 billion per month.  on january 29, 2014, the federal reserve announced additional $5 billion reductions to its monthly purchase of both agency rmbs and treasury bonds effective in february 2014.   on february 11, 2014 the new federal reserve chair janet yellen delivered her first humphrey-hawkins testimony.  her comments were largely perceived to be in-line with the consensus view that has dictated the federal reserve’s recent policy.  though she acknowledged the weak nature of several pieces of recent economic data, noting that the particularly harsh winter has negatively impacted growth, all indications are for tapering to remain on track.   the immediate effect of the announcement of qe3 was an increase in agency rmbs prices. since the initial price spike, prices for all securities have receded below the price levels that existed before the announcement of qe3. it is unclear what effect, if any, the incremental reduction in the rate of the federal reserve’s monthly purchases will have on the value of the agency rmbs in which we invest. however, it is possible that the market for such securities, the price of such securities and, as a result, our net asset value and net interest margin could be negatively affected.     adoption of the basel iii standards could negatively affect our access to future financings.   in response to various financial crises and the volatility of financial markets, the basel committee on banking supervision, an international body comprised of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from 27 countries, including the united states, adopted the basel iii standards several years ago. the final package of basel iii reforms was approved by the g20 leaders in november 2010.  u.s. regulators have elected to implement substantially all of the basel iii standards. these new standards, including the supplementary leverage ratio imposed by the federal reserve board, the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency, which will be fully phased in by 2019, will require banks to hold more capital, predominantly in the form of common equity, than under the current capital framework. these increased bank capital requirements may constrain our ability to obtain attractive future financings and increase the cost of such financings if they are obtained.   the federal conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between these agencies and the u.s. government, may adversely affect our business.   the payments we receive on the agency rmbs in which we invest depend upon a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the securities and are guaranteed by ginnie mae, fannie mae or freddie mac. ginnie mae is part of a u.s. government agency and its guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. fannie mae and freddie mac are u.s. government-sponsored entities, or gses, but their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states.     18   in 2008 in response to the deteriorating financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac and the recent credit market disruption, congress and the u.s. treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these gses and the financial markets, generally. the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 was signed into law on july 30, 2008, and established the federal housing finance agency, or the fhfa, with enhanced regulatory authority over, among other things, the business activities of fannie mae and freddie mac and the size of their portfolio holdings. on september 7, 2008, in response to the deterioration in the financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac, the fhfa placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship, which is a statutory process pursuant to which the fhfa will operate fannie mae and freddie mac as conservator in an effort to stabilize the entities. the appointment of the fhfa as conservator of both fannie mae and freddie mac allows the fhfa to control the actions of the two gses without forcing them to liquidate, which would be the case under receivership. in addition, the u.s. treasury has taken steps to capitalize and provide financing to fannie mae and freddie mac and agreed to purchase direct obligations and agency rmbs issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac.   shortly after fannie mae and freddie mac were placed in federal conservatorship, the secretary of the u.s. treasury, in announcing the actions, noted that the guarantee structure of fannie mae and freddie mac required examination and that changes in the structures of the entities were necessary to reduce risk to the financial system. the future roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantees could be eliminated or considerably limited relative to historical measurements. any changes to the nature of the guarantees provided by fannie mae and freddie mac could redefine what constitutes agency rmbs and could have broad adverse market implications as well as negatively impact us.   the problems faced by fannie mae and freddie mac resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship have stirred debate among some federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the u.s. government in providing liquidity for the residential mortgage market. if federal policy makers decide that the u.s. government’s role in providing liquidity for the residential mortgage market should be reduced or eliminated, each of fannie mae and freddie mac could be dissolved and the u.s. government could decide to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market. if fannie mae or freddie mac were eliminated, or their structures were to change radically, we would not be able to acquire agency rmbs from these companies, which would drastically reduce the amount and type of agency rmbs available for investment.   our income could be negatively affected in a number of ways depending on the manner in which related events unfold. for example, the current credit support provided by the u.s. treasury to fannie mae and freddie mac, and any additional credit support it may provide in the future, could have the effect of lowering the interest rate we receive from agency rmbs, thereby tightening the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio of targeted investments and our cost of financing that portfolio. a reduction in the supply of agency rmbs could also increase the prices of agency rmbs we seek to acquire thereby reducing the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio of targeted assets and our cost of financing that portfolio.   as indicated above, recent legislation has changed the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s.  government and requires fannie mae and freddie mac to reduce the amount of mortgage loans they own or for which they provide guarantees. the effect of the actions taken by the u.s. government remains uncertain. furthermore, the scope and nature of the actions that the u.s. government will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve. future legislation could further change the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. government, and could also nationalize or eliminate these gses entirely. any law affecting these gses may create market uncertainty and have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac. as a result, such laws could increase the risk of loss on investments in fannie mae and/or freddie mac agency rmbs. it is also possible that such laws could adversely impact the market for such securities and the spreads at which they trade. all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the pricing, supply, liquidity and value of our target assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.     19   separate legislation has been introduced in both houses of the u.s. congress, which would, among other things, revoke the charters of fannie mae and freddie mac, and we could be materially adversely affected if these proposed laws were enacted.   on june 25, 2013, a bipartisan group of senators introduced the housing finance reform and taxpayer protection act of 2013, which may serve as a catalyst for congressional discussion on the reform of fannie mae and freddie mac, to the u.s. senate. on july 11, 2013, members of the house committee on financial services introduced the protecting american taxpayers and homeowners act to the u.s. house of representatives.   while the two bills are distinguishable in many respects, they have some notable commonalities. both bills call for the revocation of the charters of fannie mae and freddie mac and seek to increase the opportunities for private capital to participate in, and consequently bear the risk of loss in connection with, government-guaranteed mortgage backed securities. both bills also have considerable support in their respective houses of congress, which suggests that efforts to reform and possibly eliminate fannie mae and freddie mac may be gaining momentum.   the passage of any new legislation affecting fannie mae and freddie mac may create market uncertainty and reduce the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government through a new or existing successor entity to fannie mae and freddie mac. if the charters of fannie mae and freddie mac were revoked, it is unclear what effect, if any, this would have on the value of the existing fannie mae and freddie mac agency rmbs. it is also possible that the above-referenced proposed legislation, if made law, could adversely impact the market for securities issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government and the spreads at which they trade. the foregoing could materially adversely affect the pricing, supply, liquidity and value of our target assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.   mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and our returns on, mortgage-backed securities.   the u.s. government, through the federal reserve, the fha and the fdic, has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including the home affordable modification program, or hamp, which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, the hope for homeowners program, or the h4h program, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fha-insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and the home affordable refinance program, which allows borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments to refinance and reduce their monthly mortgage payments at loan-to-value ratios up to 125% without new mortgage insurance.   in the state of the union address in january 2013, president obama urged congress to adopt additional legislation to further assist homeowners, including those whose mortgages exceed the value of their homes, to refinance their mortgages and reduce the principal and interest payments on their mortgages.  hamp, the h4h program and other loss mitigation programs may involve, among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or to extend the payment terms of the loans. non-agency rmbs yields and cash flows could particularly be negatively impacted by a significant number of loan modifications with respect to a given security, including, but not limited to, those related to principal forgiveness and coupon reduction. these loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, mortgage-backed securities that we may purchase.   on december 10, 2013, mel watt was confirmed as the new director of fhfa, which may result in new mortgage loan or refinancing programs that could adversely impact market pricing and liquidity for our securities or the securities we target for future purchase.     20   we are subject to the risk that agencies of and entities sponsored by the u.s. government may not be able to fully satisfy their guarantees of agency rmbs or that these guarantee obligations may be repudiated, which may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities.   the interest and principal payments we receive on the agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. unlike the ginnie mae certificates in which we may invest, the principal and interest on securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are not guaranteed by the u.s. government. all the agency rmbs in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the securities.   as conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac, the fhfa may disaffirm or repudiate (subject to certain limitations for qualified financial contracts) contracts that freddie mac or fannie mae entered into prior to fhfa’s appointment as conservator if it determines, in its sole discretion, that performance of the contract is burdensome and that disaffirmation or repudiation of the contract promotes the orderly administration of its affairs. the housing and economic recovery act of 2008, or hera, requires fhfa to exercise its right to disaffirm or repudiate most contracts within a reasonable period of time after its appointment as conservator. fannie mae and freddie mac have disclosed that the fhfa has disaffirmed certain consulting and other contracts that these entities entered into prior to fhfa’s appointment as conservator. freddie mac and fannie mae have also disclosed that the fhfa has advised that it does not intend to repudiate any guarantee obligation relating to fannie mae and freddie mac’s mortgage-related securities, because fhfa views repudiation as incompatible with the goals of the conservatorship. in addition, the hera provides that mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets that have been transferred to a freddie mac or fannie mae securitization trust must be held for the beneficial owners of the related mortgage-related securities, and cannot be used to satisfy the general creditors of freddie mac or fannie mae.   if the guarantee obligations of freddie mac or fannie mae were repudiated by the fhfa, payments of principal and/or interest to holders of agency rmbs issued by freddie mac or fannie mae would be reduced in the event of any borrowers’ late payments or failure to pay or a servicer’s failure to remit borrower payments to the trust. in that case, trust administration and servicing fees could be paid from mortgage payments prior to distributions to holders of agency rmbs. any actual direct compensatory damages owed due to the repudiation of freddie mac or fannie mae’s guarantee obligations may not be sufficient to offset any shortfalls experienced by holders of agency rmbs. fhfa also has the right to transfer or sell any asset or liability of freddie mac or fannie mae, including its guarantee obligation, without any approval, assignment or consent. if fhfa were to transfer freddie mac or fannie mae’s guarantee obligations to another party, holders of agency rmbs would have to rely on that party for satisfaction of the guarantee obligation and would be exposed to the credit risk of that party.   we cannot predict the impact, if any, on our earnings or cash available for distribution to our stockholders of the fhfa's proposed revisions to fannie mae's, freddie mac's and ginnie mae's existing infrastructures to align the standards and practices of the three entities.   on february 21, 2012, the fhfa released its strategic plan for enterprise conservatorships, which set forth three goals for the next phase of the fannie mae and freddie mac conservatorships. these three goals are to (i) build a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market, (ii) gradually contract fannie mae and freddie mac's presence in the marketplace while simplifying and shrinking their operations, and (iii) maintain foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages. on october 4, 2012, the fhfa released its white paper entitled building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market, which proposes a new infrastructure for fannie mae and freddie mac that has two basic goals.   the first such goal is to replace the current, outdated infrastructures of fannie mae and freddie mac with a common, more efficient infrastructure that aligns the standards and practices of the two entities, beginning with core functions performed by both entities such as issuance, master servicing, bond administration, collateral management and data integration. the second goal is to establish an operating framework for fannie mae and freddie mac that is consistent with the progress of housing finance reform and encourages and accommodates the increased participation of private capital in assuming credit risk associated with the secondary mortgage market.   the fhfa recognizes that there are a number of impediments to their goals which may or may not be surmountable, such as the absence of any significant secondary mortgage market mechanisms beyond fannie mae, freddie mac and ginnie mae, and that their proposals are in the formative stages. as a result, it is unclear if the proposals will be enacted. if such proposals are enacted, it is unclear how closely what is enacted will resemble the proposals from the fhfa white paper or what the effects of the enactment will be in terms of our net asset value, earnings or cash available for distribution to our stockholders.     21   risks related to financing and hedging   we may incur significant debt in the future, which will subject us to increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders.   subject to market conditions and availability, we may further increase our debt in the future. we use leverage to finance our assets through borrowings from repurchase agreements and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. although we are not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio, the amount of leverage we deploy for particular assets depends upon our manager’s assessment of the credit and other risks of those assets. our board of directors may establish and change our leverage policy at any time without stockholder approval. in addition, we may leverage individual assets at substantially higher levels. incurring debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that:     • our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing agreements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those agreements and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale;         • our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment yields will increase with higher financing costs;         • we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, investments, stockholder distributions or other purposes; and         • we may not be able to refinance debt that matures prior to the investment it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all.   interest rate fluctuations could significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments.   interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. interest rate fluctuations present a variety of risks to our operations. our primary interest rate exposure relates to the yield on our investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as any interest rate derivatives that we utilize for hedging purposes. changes in interest rates will affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income will result in operating losses for us. changes in the level of interest rates also may affect our ability to invest in investments, the value of our investments and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets. changes in interest rates may also affect borrower default rates and may impact the ability of borrowers to refinance or modify loans and/or to sell real estate assets owned.  such change could negatively impact the value of our investments.   most of our financing costs are determined by reference to floating rates, such as libor or a treasury index, plus a margin, the amount of which will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, (i) for collateralized debt, the value and liquidity of the collateral, and for non-collateralized debt, our credit, (ii) the level and movement of interest rates and (iii) general market conditions and liquidity. in a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense on floating-rate debt would increase, while any additional interest income we earn on our floating-rate investments may not compensate for such increase in interest expense, the interest income we earn on our fixed-rate investments would not change, the duration and weighted average life of our fixed-rate investments would increase and the market value of our fixed-rate investments would decrease. similarly, in a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on floating-rate investments would decrease, while any decrease in the interest we are charged on our floating-rate debt may not compensate for such decrease in interest income and interest we are charged on our fixed-rate debt would not change. any such scenario could materially and adversely affect us.   our operating results depend, in large part, on differences between the income earned on our investments, net of credit losses, and our financing costs. we anticipate that, in most cases, for any period during which our investments are not match-funded, the income earned on such investments will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may immediately and significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments.     22   we depend, and may in the future depend, on repurchase agreement financing to acquire rmbs, abs and cmbs, and our inability to access this funding could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.   we use repurchase agreement financing as a strategy to increase the return on our assets. however, we may not be able to achieve our desired leverage ratio for a number of reasons, including if the following events occur:     • our lenders do not make repurchase agreement financing available to us at acceptable rates;   • certain of our lenders exit the repurchase market;   • our lenders require that we pledge additional collateral to cover our borrowings, which we may be unable to do; or   • we determine that the leverage would expose us to excessive risk.   our ability to fund our purchases of rmbs, abs and cmbs may be impacted by our ability to secure repurchase agreement financing on acceptable terms. we can provide no assurance that lenders will be willing or able to provide us with sufficient financing. in addition, because repurchase agreements represent commitments of capital, lenders may respond to market conditions by making it more difficult for us to secure continued financing. during certain periods of the credit cycle, lenders may curtail their willingness to provide dual financing.   if major market participants exit the repurchase agreement financing business, the value of our rmbs, abs and cmbs could be negatively impacted, thus reducing net stockholders’ equity, or book value. furthermore, if many of our lenders or potential lenders are unwilling or unable to provide us with repurchase agreement financing, we could be forced to sell our rmbs, abs and cmbs assets at an inopportune time when prices are depressed.   in addition, if the regulatory capital requirements imposed on our lenders change, our lenders may be required to significantly increase the cost of the financing that they provide to us. our lenders also may revise their eligibility requirements for the types of assets they are willing to finance or the terms of such financings, based on, among other factors, the regulatory environment and their management of perceived risk, particularly with respect to assignee liability.   moreover, the amount of financing we receive, or may in the future receive, under our repurchase agreements is directly related to the lenders’ valuations of the rmbs, abs and cmbs that secure the outstanding borrowings. if we are unable to access or maintain financing for our rmbs and other assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and liquidity.   our current lenders require, and future lenders may require, us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations.   as of december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, we had entered into mras, with 30 counterparties, under which we had borrowed an aggregate $2.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, from 24 and 29 counterparties, respectively, on a gaap basis. as of december 31, 2013, the borrowings under repurchase agreements had maturities between january 2, 2014 and may 29, 2014, and as of december 31, 2012, the borrowings under repurchase agreements had maturities between january 2, 2013 and june 17, 2013. these agreements generally include customary representations, warranties and covenants, but may also contain more restrictive supplemental terms and conditions. although specific to each master repurchase agreement, typical supplemental terms include requirements of minimum equity, leverage ratios, performance triggers or other financial ratios. if we fail to meet or satisfy any covenants, supplemental terms or representations and warranties, we would be in default under these agreements and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. certain financing agreements may contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other agreements could also declare a default. further, under our repurchase agreements, we may be required to pledge additional assets to our lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral, which may take the form of additional securities or cash.     23   future lenders may impose similar restrictions on us that would affect our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments or acquisitions, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem debt or equity securities and impact our flexibility to determine our operating policies and investment strategies. for example, our loan documents may contain negative covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to repurchase our common stock, distribute more than a certain amount of our net income or funds from operations to our stockholders, employ leverage beyond certain amounts, sell assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens and enter into transactions with affiliates. if we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. we may also be subject to cross-default and acceleration rights and, with respect to collateralized debt, the posting of additional collateral and foreclosure rights upon default. further, this could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the qualification requirements necessary to maintain our status as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes.   in the event non-recourse long-term financing structures become available to us in the future, our inability to enter into such structures may expose us to risks which could result in losses to us.   under current market conditions, non-recourse long-term financing for our investments is not widely available, but we may utilize these financing structures if and when they become available. in such structures, our lenders typically would not have a general claim against us as an entity, as opposed to the assets themselves. we also may finance our investments on a long-term basis through issuances of equity and non-collateralized debt in the capital markets or otherwise, to the extent such financing is available. prior to any such financing, we may seek to finance our investments with relatively short-term facilities until a sufficient portfolio is accumulated. as a result, we would be subject to the risk that we would not be able to acquire, during the period that any short-term facilities are available, sufficient eligible assets or securities to maximize the efficiency of a securitization. we also would bear the risk that we would not be able to obtain new short-term facilities or would not be able to renew any short-term facilities after they expire should we need more time to seek and acquire sufficient eligible assets or securities for a securitization. in addition, conditions in the capital markets, including the current volatility in the capital and credit markets, may not permit a non-recourse securitization at any particular time or may make the issuance of any such securitization less attractive to us even when we do have sufficient eligible assets or securities. while we would intend to retain the unrated equity component of securitizations and, therefore, still have exposure to any investments included in such securitizations, our inability to enter into such securitizations would increase our overall exposure to risks associated with direct ownership of such investments, including the risk of default. our inability to refinance any short-term facilities would also increase our risk because borrowings thereunder would likely be recourse to us as an entity. if we are unable to obtain and renew short-term facilities or to consummate securitizations to finance our investments on a long-term basis, we may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price.   if a counterparty to our repurchase transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of that term, or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement, we will lose money on our repurchase transactions.   when we engage in repurchase transactions, we generally sell securities to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receive cash from the lenders. the lenders are obligated to resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. because the cash we receive from lenders when we initially sell the securities to the lender is less than the value of those securities (this difference is the haircut), if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same securities back to us we may incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). at december 31, 2013, we had greater than 5% stockholders’ equity at risk with each of three repurchase agreement counterparties: credit suisse, merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith and wells fargo bank, n.a.   we will also lose money on a repurchase transaction if the value of the underlying securities has declined as of the end of the transaction term, as we will have to repurchase the securities for their initial value but will receive securities worth less than that amount. further, if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction, the lender will be able to terminate the transaction and cease entering into any other repurchase transactions with us. if a default occurs under any of our repurchase agreements and the lenders terminate one or more of our repurchase agreements, we may need to enter into replacement repurchase agreements with different lenders. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement repurchase agreements on the same terms as the repurchase agreements that were terminated or at all. any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could adversely affect our earnings and thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.     24   our use or future use of repurchase agreements to finance our rmbs, abs and cmbs may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender files for bankruptcy.   our borrowings or future borrowings under repurchase agreements for our rmbs, abs and cmbs may qualify for special treatment under the u.s. bankruptcy code, giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate the assets that we have pledged under their repurchase agreements without delay in the event that we file for bankruptcy. furthermore, the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the u.s. bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that a lender party to such agreement files for bankruptcy. therefore, our use of repurchase agreements to finance our investments exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or us.   our rights under our repurchase agreements may be subject to the effects of the bankruptcy laws in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of us or our lenders under the repurchase agreements, which may allow our lenders to repudiate our repurchase agreements.   in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy, certain repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the u.s. bankruptcy code, the effect of which, among other things, would be to allow the lender under the applicable repurchase agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code and to foreclose on the pledged collateral without delay. in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a lender during the term of a repurchase agreement, the lender may be permitted, under applicable insolvency laws, to repudiate the contract, and our claim against the lender for damages may be treated simply as that of an unsecured creditor. in addition, if the lender is a broker or dealer subject to the securities investor protection act of 1970, or an insured depository institution subject to the federal deposit insurance act, our ability to exercise our rights to recover our securities under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender’s insolvency may be further limited by those statutes. these claims would be subject to significant delay and, if and when received, may be substantially less than the damages we actually incur.   the repurchase agreements that we use to finance our investments may require us to provide additional collateral and may restrict us from leveraging our assets as fully as desired.   we use repurchase agreements to finance our acquisition of rmbs, abs and cmbs. if the market value of the rmbs, abs and cmbs pledged or sold by us to a counterparty declines, we may be required by the counterparty to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced, but we may not have the funds or unpledged liquid investments available to do so, which could result in defaults. posting additional collateral to support our credit will reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets, which could adversely affect our business. in the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to meet such requirements, counterparties can accelerate repayment of our indebtedness, increase interest rates, liquidate our collateral or terminate our ability to borrow. additionally, in order to obtain cash to satisfy a margin call, we may be required to liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause us to incur further losses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. such a situation would likely result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for bankruptcy protection.   further, counterparties may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash uninvested or to set aside non-levered assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. as a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on equity. if we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly.   hedging against interest rate exposure may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.   subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit and our exemption under the investment company act, we pursue hedging strategies to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level of interest rates, the type of investments held, and other changing market conditions. interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:     • interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;   • available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;   • the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability or asset;   • the amount of income that a reit may earn from hedging transactions to offset interest rate losses is limited by u.s. federal tax provisions governing reits;     • the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and   • the hedging counterparty owing the money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.   in addition, we may fail to recalculate, re-adjust and execute hedges in an efficient manner.     25   our hedging activities, which are intended to limit losses, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. therefore, while we may enter into such transactions seeking to reduce interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. in addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in hedging strategies and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. moreover, it may be impossible to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged. any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to increased risk of loss.   we may enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future.   subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit, part of our investment strategy involves entering into hedging transactions that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (such as the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument). the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open hedging positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. these economic losses will be reflected in our results of operations, and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition.   hedging instruments may not be traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any u.s. or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses.   the cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument lengthens during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. we may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising and hedging costs have increased. in addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they may not be traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any u.s. or foreign governmental authorities. consequently, there may be few or no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. the business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default. default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to replace the affected hedging instruments, at the then current market price. although generally we seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. no assurance can be given that a liquid secondary market will exist for derivative instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in significant losses.   clearing facilities or exchanges upon which some of our hedging instruments are traded may increase margin requirements on our hedging instruments in the event of adverse economic developments.   in response to events having or expected to have adverse economic consequences or which create market uncertainty, clearing facilities or exchanges upon which some of our hedging instruments, such as interest rate caps and swaps, are traded may require us to post additional collateral against our hedging instruments. in response to the u.s. approaching its debt ceiling without resolution and the government shutdown, the chicago mercantile exchange announced on october 15, 2013 that it would increase margin requirements by 12% for all over-the-counter interest rate swap portfolios that its clearinghouse guaranteed. this increase was subsequently rolled back on october 17, 2013 upon the news that congress passed legislation to temporarily suspend the debt ceiling and reopen the government, which allowed time for broader negotiations concerning budgetary issues. in the event that future adverse economic developments or market uncertainty result in increased margin requirements for our hedging instruments, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity position, business, financial condition and results of operations.     26   risks related to our investments   difficult conditions in the residential real estate market may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings.   our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the mortgage market, the residential and commercial real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy generally. continuing concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the mortgage market and the strength of the recovery in the real estate market have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets. the residential and commercial mortgage markets have been severely affected by changes in the lending landscape and there is no assurance that these conditions have permanently stabilized or that they will not worsen in the future. the severity of limited liquidity was largely unanticipated by the markets, and access to mortgages was and in many cases continues to be substantially limited. this has impacted new demand for homes, which has compressed the home ownership rate and may weigh heavily on future home price performance.  furthermore, there is a strong correlation between home price appreciation and mortgage loan delinquencies.  delinquency rates may impact the performance of the credit securities we hold in our portfolio.   declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect our results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   a substantial portion of our assets are reported for accounting purposes at fair value. changes in the market values of those assets are directly charged or credited to earnings for the period. as a result, a decline in values will reduce the book value of our company.   a decline in the market value of our assets may adversely affect us, particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets. if the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan. if we were unable to post the additional collateral, we would have to sell the assets at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so.   the mortgage loans that we acquire, the mortgages underlying the rmbs that we acquire, the commercial mortgage loans underlying the cmbs that we acquire and the assets underlying the abs are all subject to defaults, foreclosure timeline extension, fraud, price depreciation and unfavorable modification of loan principal amount, interest rate and premium, any of which could result in losses to us.   in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan.   our investments in rmbs are subject to the risks of defaults, foreclosure timeline extension, fraud and home price depreciation and unfavorable modification of loan principal amount, interest rate and amortization of principal, accompanying the underlying residential mortgage loans. the ability of a borrower to repay a mortgage loan secured by a residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower. a number of factors may impair borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans, including:     • acts of god, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses;   • acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on september 11, 2001;   • adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;   • changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;   • costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as indoor mold;   • the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses; and   • the availability of refinancing.     27   in the event of defaults on the residential mortgage loans that underlie our investments in rmbs and the exhaustion of any underlying or any additional credit support, we may not realize our anticipated return on our investments and we may incur a loss on these investments.   cmbs are secured by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans. accordingly, the cmbs we invest in are subject to all of the risks of the respective underlying commercial mortgage loans. commercial mortgage loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of single-family residential property. the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. if the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. net operating income of an income-producing property can be affected by, among other things,   • tenant mix;   • success of tenant businesses;   • property management decisions;   • property location and condition;   • competition from comparable types of properties;   • changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;   • any need to address environmental contamination at the property or the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property;   • changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments;   • declines in regional or local real estate values;   • declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates;   • increases in interest rates;   • real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;   • changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; and   • acts of god, terrorist attacks, social unrest and civil disturbances.     abs are securities backed by various asset classes including, but not limited to, small balance commercial mortgages, aircraft, automobiles, credit cards, equipment, manufactured housing, franchises, recreational vehicles and student loans. abs remain subject to the credit exposure of the underlying receivables. in the event of increased rates of delinquency with respect to any receivables underlying our abs, we may not realize our anticipated return on these investments.   the failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying the rmbs in our portfolio or any mortgage loans we own may materially and adversely affect us.   most residential mortgage loans and securitizations of residential mortgage loans require a servicer to manage collections on each of the underlying loans. both default frequency and default severity of loans may depend upon the quality of the servicer. if servicers are not vigilant in encouraging borrowers to make their monthly payments, the borrowers may be far less likely to make these payments, which could result in a higher frequency of default. if servicers take longer to liquidate non-performing assets, loss severities may tend to be higher than originally anticipated. higher loss severity may also be caused by less competent dispositions of reo properties. the failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying the rmbs in our portfolio or any mortgage loans we own could negatively impact the value of our investments and our performance. servicer quality is of prime importance in the default performance of residential mortgage loans and rmbs. many servicers have gone out of business in recent years, requiring a transfer of servicing to another servicer. this transfer takes time and loans may become delinquent because of confusion or lack of attention. when servicing is transferred, servicing fees may increase which may have an adverse effect on the credit support of rmbs held by us. in the case of pools of securitized loans, servicers may be required to advance interest on delinquent loans to the extent the servicer deems those advances recoverable. in the event the servicer does not advance, interest may be interrupted even on more senior securities. servicers may also advance more than is in fact recoverable once a defaulted loan is disposed, and the loss to the trust may be greater than the outstanding principal balance of that loan (greater than 100% loss severity).     28   we may not control the special servicing of the mortgage loans included in the cmbs in which we invest and, in such cases, the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interests.   with respect to each series of cmbs in which we invest, overall control over the special servicing of the related underlying mortgage loans is held by a “directing certificateholder” or a “controlling class representative,” which is appointed by the holders of the most subordinate class of cmbs in such series. depending on the class of cmbs we have acquired or may acquire, we may not have the right to appoint the directing certificateholder. in connection with the servicing of the specially serviced mortgage loans, the related special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificateholder, take actions with respect to the specially serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect our interests.   if our manager overestimates the loss-adjusted yields of our cmbs investments, we may experience losses.   our manager values our potential cmbs investments based on loss-adjusted yields, taking into account estimated future losses on the mortgage loans included in the securitization’s pool of loans, and the estimated impact of these losses on expected future cash flows. our manager’s loss estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. in the event that our manager underestimates the pool level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular cmbs investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment.   mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties.   we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. these types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.   bridge loans involve a greater risk of loss than traditional investment grade mortgage loans with fully insured borrowers.   we may acquire bridge loans secured by first lien mortgages on a property to borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition, construction or redevelopment of a property. the borrower has usually identified an undervalued asset that has been under-managed and/or is located in a recovering market. if the market in which the asset is located fails to recover according to the borrower’s projections, or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset’s management and/or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the bridge loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure.   in addition, borrowers usually use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a bridge loan. bridge loans therefore are subject to risks of a borrower’s inability to obtain permanent financing to repay the bridge loan. bridge loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance. in the event of any default under bridge loans held by us, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount of the bridge loan. to the extent we suffer such losses with respect to our bridge loans, the value of our company and the price of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected.   an increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the volume of certain of our target assets which could adversely affect our ability to acquire target assets that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends.   rising interest rates generally reduce the demand for mortgage loans due to the higher cost of borrowing. a reduction in the volume of mortgage loans originated may affect the volume of our target assets available to us, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire assets that satisfy our investment objectives. rising interest rates may also cause our target assets that were issued prior to an interest rate increase to provide yields that are below prevailing market interest rates. if rising interest rates cause us to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of our target assets with a yield that is above our borrowing cost, our ability to satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends may be materially and adversely affected.     29   the relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the “yield curve.” ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. if short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates (a flattening of the yield curve), our borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. because we expect our investments, on average, generally will bear interest based on longer-term rates than our borrowings, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease our net income and the market value of our net assets. additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease our net income. it is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve inversion), in which event our borrowing costs may exceed our interest income and we could incur operating losses.   interest rate mismatches between our rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of these assets may reduce our net interest income and cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates.   we fund most of our investments in long term rmbs with short term borrowings that have interest rates that adjust more frequently than the interest rate indices and repricing terms of rmbs backed by adjustable-rate mortgages, or arms or hybrid arms. accordingly, if short-term interest rates increase, our borrowing costs may increase faster than the interest rates on rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms adjust. as a result, in a period of rising interest rates, we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss.   in most cases, the interest rate indices and repricing terms of rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms and our borrowings are not identical, thereby potentially creating an interest rate mismatch between our investments and our borrowings. while the historical spread between relevant short-term interest rate indices has been relatively stable, there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile. during periods of changing interest rates, these interest rate index mismatches could reduce our net income or produce a net loss, and adversely affect the level of our dividends and the market price of our common stock.   in addition, rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms are typically subject to lifetime interest rate caps which limit the amount an interest rate can increase through the maturity of the rmbs. however, our borrowings under repurchase agreements typically are not subject to similar restrictions. accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps could limit the interest rates on these types of rmbs. this problem is magnified for rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms that are not fully indexed. further, some rmbs backed by arms or hybrid arms may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. as a result, we may receive less cash income on these types of rmbs than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. these factors could reduce our net interest income and cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates.   because we acquire fixed-rate securities, an increase in interest rates on our borrowings may adversely affect our book value.   increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our assets. any fixed-rate securities we invest in generally will be more negatively affected by these increases than adjustable-rate securities. in accordance with gaap, we are required to reduce the book value of our investments by the amount of any decrease in their fair value. we are thereby required to evaluate our assets on at least a quarterly basis to determine their fair value, by primarily using third-party pricing services and broker-dealer quotes. if the fair value of a security is not available from a dealer or third-party pricing service, we estimate the fair value of the security using a variety of methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow analysis, matrix pricing, option-adjusted spread models and fundamental analysis. aggregate characteristics taken into consideration include, but are not limited to, type of collateral, index, margin, periodic cap, lifetime cap, underwriting standards, age and delinquency experience. however, the fair value reflects estimates and may not be indicative of the amounts we would receive in a current market exchange. if we determine that a security on which we have not made a mark to market election is other-than-temporarily impaired, and we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, we would reduce the value of such security on our balance sheet by recording an impairment charge in our statement of operations.   rapid changes in the values of our residential mortgage loans and other real estate-related assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a reit or exemption from registration under the investment company act.   if the market value or income potential of our residential mortgage loans and other real estate-related assets declines as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, we may need to increase certain real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our reit qualification or exemption from registration under the investment company act. if the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. this difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of our investments. we may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent our reit and investment company act considerations.     30   changes in prepayment rates could negatively affect the value of our investment portfolio, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   the value of our investment portfolio may be affected by prepayment rates on mortgage loans. many loans do not contain any restrictions on borrowers’ abilities to prepay their residential mortgage loans and therefore the expected weighted average life of agency rmbs is generally much shorter than would be implied by their stated contractual maturities. interest only agency rmbs only entitle the holder to interest payments. therefore, the yield to maturity of interest only agency rmbs is extremely sensitive to the rate of principal payments (particularly prepayments) on the underlying pool of mortgages.   prepayment rates on loans are influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic and other factors beyond our control. consequently, we cannot predict with certainty such prepayment rates, and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks. homeowners tend to prepay mortgage loans faster when interest rates decline. consequently, owners of the loans have to reinvest the money received from the prepayments at the lower prevailing interest rates. conversely, homeowners tend not to prepay mortgage loans when interest rates increase. consequently, owners of the loans are unable to reinvest money that would have otherwise been received from prepayments at the higher prevailing interest rates. this volatility in prepayment rates may affect our ability to maintain targeted amounts of leverage on our portfolio and may result in reduced earnings or losses for us and negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   many of our investments may be illiquid and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.   we expect generally that any securities we purchase will be in connection with privately-negotiated transactions that will not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or is otherwise in accordance with, those laws. generally, we will not be able to sell these securities publicly without the expense and time required to register the securities under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities act, if the obligors agree to do so, or will be able to sell the securities only under rule 144 or other rules under the securities act which permit only limited sales under specified conditions. moreover, turbulent market conditions, such as those experienced over the last several years and as recently as the spring and summer of 2013, could significantly and negatively impact the liquidity of our assets. it may be difficult or impossible to obtain or validate third-party pricing on the investments we purchase. illiquid investments typically exhibit more volatility in price behavior, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. in addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value maintained for it in our records. furthermore, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in an entity to the extent that we have or could be attributed with material non-public information regarding such entity.   investments in subordinated loans and subordinated mortgage-backed securities could subject us to increased risk of losses.   we invest in subordinated loans and subordinated non-agency rmbs. in the event a borrower defaults on a loan and lacks sufficient assets to satisfy such loan, we may lose all or a significant part of our investment. in the event a borrower becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, we will not have any recourse to the assets, if any, of the borrower that are not pledged to secure our loan, and the unpledged assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy our loan. if a borrower defaults on our loan or on its senior debt (i.e., a first-lien loan, in the case of a residential mortgage loan, or a contractually or structurally senior loan, in the case of a commercial mortgage loan), or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after all senior debt is paid in full. in the case of commercial mortgage loans, where senior debt exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loan, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers.     31   in general, losses on mortgage loans included in a securitization will be borne first by holders of the “first loss” subordinated security and then, in turn, by the holders of more senior securities, beginning with the most subordinated. in addition, losses on the property securing a commercial mortgage loan included in a securitization will be borne first by the equity holder of the property, then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit provided by the borrower, if any, and then by subordinated security holders, as described in the preceding sentence. in the event of default of a mortgage loan we own (and, if the loan is a commercial mortgage loan, the exhaustion of any equity support, reserve fund or letter of credit) and, in the case of non-agency rmbs and cmbs in which we invest, the exhaustion of any credit support provided by any classes of securities junior to such non-agency rmbs and cmbs, we may not recover all or even a significant part of our investment, which could result in repayment losses. in addition, if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued by the originator, or if the values subsequently decline and, as a result, less collateral is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related mortgage-backed securities, the securities in which we invest may suffer significant losses.   the prices of lower credit quality investments are generally more sensitive to adverse actual or perceived economic downturns or individual issuer developments than more highly rated investments. an economic downturn or a projection of an economic downturn, for example, could cause a decline in the price of lower credit quality investments because the ability of obligors to make principal and interest payments or to refinance may be impaired. in such event, existing credit support in the securitization structure may be insufficient to protect us against loss.   any credit ratings assigned to our investments will be subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded.   some of our investments are rated by moody’s investors service, fitch ratings or standard & poor’s. any credit ratings on our investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. if rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of these investments could significantly decline, which will adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us.   insurance on real estate securities collateral may not cover all losses.   there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, also might make the insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property. any uninsured loss could result in the loss of cash flow from, and the asset value of, the affected property.   our manager’s due diligence of potential investments may not reveal all of the liabilities associated with such investments and may not reveal other weaknesses in such investments, which could lead to investment losses.   before making an investment, our manager assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the originators, borrowers, and the underlying property values, as well as other factors and characteristics that are material to the performance of the investment. in making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, our manager relies on resources available to it and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. there can be no assurance that our manager’s due diligence process will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful.   we may be adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the asset or property types in which our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.   our assets are not subject to any geographic, diversification or concentration limitations except that we concentrate in residential mortgage-related investments. accordingly, our investment portfolio may be concentrated by geography, asset, property type and/or borrower, increasing the risk of loss to us if the particular concentration in our portfolio is subject to greater risks or undergoing adverse developments. in addition, adverse conditions in the areas where the properties securing or otherwise underlying our investments are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) and local real estate conditions (such as oversupply or reduced demand) may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments. a material decline in the demand for real estate in these areas may materially and adversely affect us. lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks among our investments.     32   a prolonged economic slowdown, recession or declining real estate values could materially and adversely affect us.   we believe the risks associated with our investments will be more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession, especially if these periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. a weakening economy and declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that borrowers will default on their debt service obligations to us and that we will incur losses on our investments with them in the event of a default on a particular investment because the value of any collateral may be insufficient to cover the full amount of such investment or may require a significant amount of time to realize. in addition, under such conditions, our access to capital will generally be more limited, if available at all, and more expensive. any period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect the net interest income generated from our portfolio and our ability to make and finance future investments, which would materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.   our investments are generally recorded at fair value, and quoted prices or observable inputs may not be available to determine such value, resulting in the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine value.   the values of some of our investments may not be readily determinable. we measure the fair value of these investments quarterly, in accordance with guidance set forth in financial accounting standards board, or fasb, accounting standards codification, or asc 820-10, “fair value measurements and disclosures.” the fair value at which our assets are recorded may not be an indication of their realizable value. ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond the control of our manager, our company or our board of directors. further, fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold since market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. if we were to liquidate a particular asset, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such asset is valued.   to a large extent, our manager’s determination of the fair value of our investments depends on inputs provided by third-party dealers and pricing services. valuations of certain securities in which we invest are often difficult to obtain or are unreliable. in general, dealers and pricing services heavily disclaim their valuations. dealers may claim to furnish valuations only as an accommodation and without special compensation, and so they may disclaim any and all liability for any direct, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of any inaccuracy or incompleteness in valuations, including any act of negligence or breach of any warranty. depending on the complexity and illiquidity of a security, valuations of the same security can vary substantially from one dealer or pricing service to another. therefore, our results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair market value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.   our investments in residential and commercial whole loans are difficult to value and are dependent upon the ability to finance, refinance and securitize such investments. the inability to do so could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and earnings and limit the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   our investments may include investments in re-performing loans, or rpls, or non-performing loans, or npls. rpls are loans on which a borrower was previously delinquent but has resumed repaying.  our ability to sell rpls for a profit depends on the borrower continuing to make payments. an rpl could become a npl, which could reduce our earnings.  investments in npls and sub-performing loans may involve workout negotiations, restructuring and the possibility of foreclosure.  these processes may be lengthy and expensive.  if loans become real estate owned, or reo, servicing companies will have to manage these properties and may not be able to sell them.  see “our ability to sell reo on terms acceptable to us or at all may be limited.”   we may seek to refinance an npl or rpl to realize greater value from such loan. however, there may be impediments to executing a refinancing strategy for npls and rpls. for example, many mortgage lenders have adjusted their loan programs and underwriting standards to be more conservative, which has reduced the availability of mortgage credit to prospective borrowers. this has resulted in reduced availability of financing alternatives for borrowers seeking to refinance their mortgage loans. the decline in housing prices may also result in higher loan-to-value ratios and leave borrowers with insufficient equity in their homes to permit them to refinance. to the extent prevailing mortgage interest rates rise from their current low levels, these risks would be exacerbated. the effect of the above would likely serve to make refinancing of npls and rpls potentially more difficult and less profitable for us.   our ability to sell reo on terms acceptable to us or at all may be limited.   reo assets are illiquid relative to other assets we may own. furthermore, the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and supply and demand. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any reo assets for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of an reo asset.  in certain circumstances, we may be required to expend cash to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold, and we cannot assure that we will have cash available to correct defects or make improvements. as a result, our ownership of reos could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, earnings and cash available for distribution to our stockholders.     33   risks related to accounting   accounting rules for certain of our transactions are highly complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions. changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions could impact our financial statements.   accounting rules for mortgage loan sales and securitizations, valuations of financial instruments, investment consolidations and other aspects of our anticipated operations are highly complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions. these complexities could lead to a delay in preparation of financial information and the delivery of this information to our stockholders and also increase the risk of errors and restatements, as well as the cost of compliance. changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions could impact our financial statements and our ability to timely prepare our financial statements. our inability to timely prepare our financial statements in the future would likely adversely affect our share price significantly.   our manager utilizes analytical models and data in connection with the valuation of our investments, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith will subject us to potential risks.   given the complexity of certain of our investments and strategies, our manager must rely heavily on analytical models (both proprietary models developed by our manager and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties, or models and data. models and data are used to value investments or potential investments and also in connection with hedging our investments. when models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose us to potential risks. for example, by relying on models and data, especially valuation models, our manager may be induced to buy certain investments at prices that are too high, to sell certain other investments at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether. similarly, any hedging based on faulty models and data may prove to be unsuccessful. furthermore, any valuations of our investments that are based on valuation models may prove to be incorrect.   some of the risks of relying on analytical models and third-party data are particular to analyzing tranches from securitizations, such as mortgage-backed securities. these risks include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) collateral cash flows and/or liability structures may be incorrectly modeled in all or only certain scenarios, or may be modeled based on simplifying assumptions that lead to errors; (ii) information about collateral may be incorrect, incomplete, or misleading; (iii) collateral or bond historical performance (such as historical prepayments, defaults, cash flows, etc.) may be incorrectly reported, or subject to interpretation (e.g., different issuers may report delinquency statistics based on different definitions of what constitutes a delinquent loan); or (iv) collateral or bond information may be outdated, in which case the models may contain incorrect assumptions as to what has occurred since the date information was last updated.   some of the analytical models used by our manager, such as mortgage prepayment models, mortgage default models, and models providing risk sensitivities and duration output, are predictive in nature. the use of predictive models has inherent risks. for example, such models may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses on a cash flow and/or a mark-to-market basis. incorrect sensitivities and duration output may lead to an unsound hedging strategy. in addition, the predictive models used by our manager may differ substantially from those models used by other market participants, with the result that valuations based on these predictive models may be substantially higher or lower for certain investments than actual market prices. furthermore, since predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data and the ability of these historical models to accurately reflect future periods.   all valuation models rely on correct market data inputs. if incorrect market data is entered into even a well-founded valuation model, the resulting valuations will be incorrect. however, even if the input of market data is correct, “model prices” often differ substantially from market prices, especially for securities with complex characteristics, such as derivative securities.     34   risks associated with our management and relationship with our manager and its affiliates   we are dependent upon our manager, its affiliates and their key personnel and may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement with our manager is terminated or such key personnel are no longer available to us, which would materially and adversely affect us.   in accordance with our management agreement, we are externally managed and advised by our manager, and all of our officers are employees of angelo, gordon or its affiliates. we have no separate facilities and we have no employees. pursuant to our management agreement, our manager is obligated to supply us with our senior management team, and the members of that team may have conflicts in allocating their time and services between us and other entities or accounts managed by our manager, now or in the future, including other angelo, gordon funds. substantially all of our investment, financing and risk management decisions are made by our manager and not by us, and our manager also has significant discretion as to the implementation of our operating policies and strategies. furthermore, our manager has the sole discretion to hire and fire employees, and our board of directors and stockholders have no authority over the individual employees of our manager, although our board of directors does have authority over our officers who are supplied by our manager. accordingly, we are completely reliant upon, and our success depends exclusively on, our manager’s personnel, services, resources, facilities, relationships and contacts. no assurance can be given that our manager will act in our best interests with respect to the allocation of personnel, services and resources to our business. in addition, the management agreement does not require our manager to dedicate specific personnel to us or to require personnel servicing our business to allocate a specific amount of time to us. the failure of any of our manager’s key personnel to service our business with the requisite time and dedication, or the departure of such personnel from our manager, or the failure of our manager to attract and retain key personnel, would materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate industry, distress in the credit markets or other times when we will need focused support and assistance from our manager, the attention of our manager’s personnel and executive officers and the resources of angelo, gordon will also be required by the other funds and accounts managed by our manager and its affiliates, placing our manager’s resources in high demand. in such situations, we may not receive the level of support and assistance that we may receive if we were internally managed or if our manager did not act as a manager for other entities. if the management agreement is terminated and a suitable replacement for our manager is not secured in a timely manner or at all, we would likely be unable to execute our business plan, which would materially and adversely affect us.   the management agreement was not negotiated on an arm’s length basis and the terms, including the fees payable to our manager, may not be as favorable to us as if the agreement was negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.   all of our officers and our non-independent directors are employees of angelo, gordon or its affiliates. the management agreement was negotiated between related parties, and we did not have the benefit of arm’s length negotiations of the type normally conducted with an unaffiliated third party and the terms, including the fees payable to our manager, may not be as favorable to us. we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the management agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our manager.   we expect that our manager will source all of our investments, and existing or future entities or accounts managed by our manager may compete with us for, or may participate in, some of those investments, which could result in conflicts of interest.   although we are subject to angelo, gordon’s allocation policy which specifically addresses some of the conflicts relating to our investment opportunities, there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise or will address such conflicts in a manner that results in the allocation of a particular investment opportunity to us or is otherwise favorable to us. our manager may be precluded from transacting in particular investments in certain situations, including but not limited to situations where angelo, gordon or its affiliates may have a prior contractual commitment with other accounts or clients or as to which angelo, gordon or any of its affiliates possess material, non-public information. consistent with angelo, gordon’s fiduciary duty to all of its clients, it may give priority in the allocation of investment opportunities to certain clients to the extent necessary to apply regulatory requirements, client guidelines and/or contractual obligations. angelo, gordon or our manager may determine that an investment opportunity is appropriate for a particular account, but not for another. in addition, angelo, gordon or its employees may invest in opportunities declined by our manager for us. the investment allocation policy may be amended by angelo, gordon at any time without our consent. as the investment programs of the various entities and accounts managed by angelo, gordon change and develop over time, additional issues and considerations may affect angelo, gordon’s allocation policy and its expectations with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities.     35   our manager and angelo, gordon and their employees also may have ongoing relationships with the obligors of investments or the clients’ counterparties and they or their clients may own equity or other securities or obligations issued by such parties. in addition, angelo, gordon, either for its own accounts or for the accounts of other clients, may hold securities or obligations that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities or obligations that are acquired for us. employees may also invest in other entities managed by other managers which are eligible to purchase target assets. angelo, gordon or our manager and their respective employees may make investment decisions for us that may be different from those undertaken for their personal accounts or on behalf of other clients (including the timing and nature of the action taken). angelo, gordon and its affiliates may at certain times simultaneously seek to purchase or sell the same or similar investments for clients or for themselves. likewise, our manager may on our behalf purchase or sell an investment in which another angelo, gordon client or affiliate is already invested or has co-invested. we have not adopted any policy which would allow us to, or prohibit us from, buying or otherwise obtaining assets from any angelo, gordon client or selling or transferring any assets to such clients.   our board of directors has approved very broad investment policies for our manager and does not review or approve each investment decision made by our manager.   our manager is authorized to follow very broad investment policies and, therefore, has great latitude in determining the types of assets that are proper investments for us, allocations among asset classes and individual investment decisions. in the future, our manager may make investments with lower rates of return than those anticipated under current market conditions and/or may make investments with greater risks to achieve those anticipated returns. our board of directors periodically reviews our investment policies and our investment portfolio but does not review or approve each proposed investment by our manager. in addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors relies primarily on information provided to it by our manager. furthermore, our manager may use complex strategies, and transactions entered into by our manager may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our board of directors.   the management fee may not provide sufficient incentive to our manager to maximize risk-adjusted returns on our investment portfolio because it is based on our stockholders’ equity, adjusted for certain non-cash and other items, and not on our performance.   our manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our stockholders’ equity, adjusted for certain non-cash and other items as further discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”, at the end of each quarter. accordingly, the possibility exists that significant management fees could be payable to our manager for a given quarter despite the fact that we could experience a net loss during that quarter. our manager’s entitlement to such significant non-performance-based compensation may not provide sufficient incentive to our manager to devote its time and effort to source and maximize risk-adjusted returns on our investment portfolio, which could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. the compensation payable to our manager will increase as a result of any future issuances of our equity securities, even if the issuances are dilutive to existing stockholders.       termination of our management agreement would be costly and, in certain cases, not permitted.   it is difficult and costly to terminate the management agreement we have entered into with our manager without cause. our independent directors review our manager’s performance and the management fees annually, and following the initial term ending june 30, 2014, the management agreement provides that it may be terminated annually by us without cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors or by a vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock, in each case based upon (i) our manager’s unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) our determination that the management fees payable to our manager are not fair, subject to our manager’s right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. our manager must be provided 180-days’ prior notice of any such termination. we may not terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement, even in the event of our manager’s poor performance, without having to pay substantial termination fees. upon any such termination without cause, the management agreement provides that we will pay our manager a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by our manager during the 24-month period prior to termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. while under certain circumstances the obligation to make such a payment might not be enforceable, this provision may increase the cost to us of terminating the management agreement and adversely affect our ability to terminate the management agreement without cause.   our manager may terminate the management agreement if we become required to register as an investment company under the investment company act with termination deemed to occur immediately before such event, in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee to our manager. furthermore, our manager may decline to renew the management agreement by providing us with 180 days’ written notice, in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee to our manager. our manager may also terminate the management agreement upon at least 60 days’ prior written notice if we default in the performance of any material term of the management agreement and the default continues for a period of 30 days after written notice to us, whereupon we would be required to pay to our manager the termination fee described above. if the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our business plan.     36   depository institutions that finance our investments may require that ag reit management, llc remain as our manager under the management agreement and that certain key personnel of our manager continue to service our business. if ag reit management, llc ceases to be our manager or one or more of our manager’s key personnel are no longer servicing our business, it may constitute an event of default and the depository institution providing the arrangement may have acceleration rights with respect to outstanding borrowings and termination rights with respect to our ability to finance our future investments with that institution. if we are unable to obtain financing for our accelerated borrowings and for our future investments under such circumstances, we may be required to curtail our asset acquisitions and/or dispose of assets at an inopportune time.   in prior years our manager has waived its right to certain reimbursements pursuant to the management agreement. if our manager decides in the future not to grant such waiver, our operating expenses would increase.   we are required to reimburse our manager for operating expenses related to the company that are incurred by our manager, including expenses relating to legal, accounting, due diligence and other services. for the years ended december 31, 2013, december 31, 2012 and the period ended december 31, 2011, the manager had incurred approximately $6.5 million, $4.4 million, and $1.9 million respectively, of reimbursable expenses. the company has expensed into other operating expenses $6.5 million and $2.2 million during the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively, and $0.0 million for the period ended december 31, 2011. the manager did not waive any expense reimbursements for the year ended december 31, 2013. the manager waived its right to receive expense reimbursements of $2.2 million and $1.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 and the period ended december 31, 2011, respectively. as such, our other operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2012 and the period ended december 31, 2011 were lower than they otherwise would have been, had our manager not waived its right to certain reimbursements. if our manager decides in the future not to grant such waiver, our operating expenses would increase and such increase may be substantial.     37   risks related to our organization and structure   loss of our exemption from regulation under the investment company act would negatively affect the value of shares of our common stock and our ability to distribute cash to our stockholders.   we conduct our operations so that we and each of our subsidiaries maintain an exemption from the investment company act.  we conduct our operations such that we meet the 40% test set forth in section 3(a)(1)(c) of the investment company act.  this test requires us to ensure that no more than 40% of our assets are “investment securities.”  “investment securities” do not include, among other things, u.s. government securities, and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that (i) are not investment companies and (ii) are not relying on the exceptions from the definition of investment company provided by section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the investment company act (the so called “private investment company” exemptions).   we generally conduct our wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries’ (including ag mit, llc’s) operations so that they are exempted from investment company status in reliance upon section 3(c)(5)(c) of the investment company act (and thus our investment in these subsidiaries is a “good asset” for our 40% test). section 3(c)(5)(c) exempts from the definition of “investment company” entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. the staff of the securities and exchange commission, or the sec, generally requires an entity relying on section 3(c)(5)(c) to invest at least 55% of its portfolio in “qualifying assets” and at least another 25% in additional qualifying assets or in “real estate-related” assets (with no more than 20% comprised of miscellaneous assets).   the method we use to classify our and our subsidiaries’ assets for purposes of the investment company act is based in large measure upon no-action positions taken by the sec staff. these no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued decades ago. no assurance can be given that the sec or its staff will concur with our classification of our or our subsidiaries’ assets or that the sec or its staff will not, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to reclassify those assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from regulation under the investment company act. for example, in august 2011 the sec issued a concept release seeking, among other things, comments on the sec’s staff’s historical interpretive positions concerning the application of section 3(c)(5)(c). in that release the sec requested comments about how section 3(c)(5)(c) is interpreted by, and affects investors in, reits, whether the sec should take action to provide greater clarity, consistency or regulatory certainty regarding the application of section 3(c)(5)(c) and whether it would be advisable for the sec to engage in rulemaking with regard to section 3(c)(5)(c) (such as by defining terms or establishing a safe harbor), to issue an interpretive release concerning the application of section 3(c)(5)(c) to reits, to provide exemptive relief or to engage in no further action at this time. to the extent that the sec or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding section 3(c)(5)(c) or any of the other matters bearing upon the definition of investment company and the exceptions to that definition, we may be required to adjust our investment strategy accordingly. additional guidance from the sec or its staff could inhibit our ability to pursue the investment strategy we have chosen.   qualification for exemption from the definition of investment company under the investment company act limits our ability to make certain investments. for example, these restrictions limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to invest directly in mortgage-related securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations, certain real estate companies or assets not related to real estate. although we monitor our and our subsidiaries’ portfolios, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the exemptions from registration for us and each of our subsidiaries.   if we fail to qualify for this exemption, or the sec determines that companies that invest in rmbs are no longer able to rely on this exemption, we could be required to restructure our activities in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act, either of which could negatively affect the value of shares of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.   failure to maintain an exemption from being regulated as a commodity pool operator could subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements and may result in fines and other penalties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, or the dodd-frank act, established a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivative contracts commonly referred to as “swaps.” as a result, any investment fund that trades in swaps may be considered a “commodity pool,” which would cause its operators (and in some cases the fund's directors) to be regulated as “commodity pool operators,” or cpos. under new rules adopted by the u.s. commodity futures trading commission, or the cftc, those funds that become commodity pools solely because of their use of swaps must register with the national futures association, or nfa. registration requires compliance with the cftc's regulations and the nfa's rules with respect to capital raising, disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and other business conduct. however, the cftc's division of swap dealer and intermediary oversight recently issued a no-action letter saying, although it believes that mortgage reits are properly considered commodity pools, it would not recommend that the cftc take enforcement action against the operator of a mortgage reit who does not register as a cpo if, among other things, the mortgage reit limits the initial margin and premiums required to establish its swaps, futures and other commodity interest positions to not more than five percent of its total assets, the mortgage reit limits the net income derived annually from those commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent of its gross income and interests in the mortgage reit are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options or swaps markets.   we use hedging instruments in conjunction with our investment portfolio and related borrowings to reduce or mitigate risks associated with changes in interest rates, mortgage spreads, yield curve shapes and market volatility. these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps, and may include interest rate futures and options on interest rate futures. we do not currently engage in any speculative derivatives activities or other non-hedging transactions using swaps, futures or options on futures. we do not use these instruments for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, and we do not consider our company or our operations to be a commodity pool as to which cpo registration or compliance is required. we have submitted the required filing to claim the no-action relief afforded by the above-described no-action letter. consequently, we will be restricted to operating within the parameters discussed in the no-action letter and will not enter into hedging transactions covered by the no-action letter if they would cause us to exceed the limits set forth in the no-action letter.     38   the cftc has substantial enforcement power with respect to violations of the laws over which it has jurisdiction, including its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions. for example, the cftc may suspend or revoke the registration of or the no-action relief afforded to a person who fails to comply with commodities laws and regulations, prohibit such a person from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil money penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. additionally, a private right of action exists against those who violate the laws over which the cftc has jurisdiction or who willfully aid, abet, counsel, induce or procure a violation of those laws. in the event that we fail to comply with statutory requirements relating to derivatives or with the cftc's rules thereunder, including the conditions in the no-action letter described above, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and other civil or governmental actions or proceedings, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit a change in our control.   certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law, or the mgcl, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in our control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares. we are subject to the “business combination” provisions of the mgcl that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting shares) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and, thereafter, imposes special stockholder voting requirements to approve these combination unless the consideration being received by common stockholders satisfies certain conditions. these provisions of the mgcl do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person, provided that the business combination is first approved by our board of directors. this resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. if this resolution is repealed, or our board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination, this statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.   the “control share” provisions of the mgcl provide that “control shares” of a maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in the election of directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the acquisition of “control shares,” subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our directors who are also our employees. our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares. there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.   the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of the mgcl permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions since we have a class of equity securities registered under the exchange act, and at least three directors who are not officers or employees of the corporation and are not affiliated with any acquiring person. these provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. our charter contains a provision whereby we elect to be subject to the provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors as soon as we become eligible to do so.   our authorized but unissued common and preferred shares may prevent a change in our control.   our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock and preferred shares. in addition, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, increase the aggregate number of our authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred shares and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. as a result, among other things, our board may establish a class or series of common stock or preferred shares that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.     39   our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.   our charter limits the liability of our present and former directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law. under current maryland law, our present and former directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:   • actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or   • active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action.   our charter authorizes us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law. our bylaws require us to indemnify each present and former director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service to us. in addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. as a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.   our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management.   our charter and bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of any series of preferred shares, a director may be removed only for “cause” (as defined in our charter), and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. vacancies generally may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum, for the full term of the director who vacated. these requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in our control that is in the best interests of our stockholders.   our charter generally does not permit ownership in excess of 9.8% of our common stock and attempts to acquire our shares in excess of the share ownership limits will be ineffective unless an exemption is granted by our board of directors.   our charter generally prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 9.8% by vote or value, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may grant an exemption to these prohibitions, subject to certain conditions and receipt by our board of certain representations and undertakings. our board of directors may from time to time increase certain of these limits for one or more persons and may increase or decrease such limits for all other persons. any decrease in the share ownership limits generally applicable to all stockholders will not be effective for any person whose percentage ownership of our shares is in excess of such decreased limits until such time as such person’s percentage ownership of our shares equals or falls below such decreased limits, but any further acquisition of our shares in excess of such person’s percentage ownership of our shares will be in violation of the applicable limits. our board of directors may not increase these limits (whether for one person or all stockholders) if such increase would allow five or fewer persons to beneficially own more than 49.9% in value of our outstanding shares or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit.   the constructive ownership rules contained in our charter are complex and may cause the outstanding shares owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than these percentages of the outstanding shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of these percentages of the outstanding shares and thus violate the share ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer our common stock or preferred shares (if and when issued) in excess of the share ownership limits without the consent of our board of directors or in a manner that would cause us to be “closely held” under section 856(h) of the code (without regard to whether the shares are held during the last half of a taxable year) will result in the shares being deemed to be transferred to a director for a charitable trust or, if the transfer to the charitable trust is not automatically effective to prevent a violation of the share ownership limits or the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares, any such transfer of our shares will be void ab initio. further, any transfer of our shares that would result in our shares being held by fewer than 100 persons will be void ab initio.       40   risks related to taxation   our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   we operate in a manner that is intended to cause us to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. however, the u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits are complex, and interpretations of the u.s. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited. qualifying as a reit requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding stock, and the amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis.   our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. although we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a reit, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year.   if we fail to qualify as a reit in any calendar year, we would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. further, if we fail to qualify as a reit, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any resulting tax. our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our reit taxable income to our stockholders. unless our failure to qualify as a reit was subject to relief under u.s. federal tax laws, we could not re-elect to qualify as a reit for four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify.   complying with the reit requirements can be difficult and may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.   to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares. we may be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.   the reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategies.   we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to u.s. federal corporate, and may be subject to state and local income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under u.s. federal income tax laws. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code and to avoid paying corporate income tax on undistributed income. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the distribution requirements of the code.   we may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements in certain circumstances. due to the nature of the assets in which we will invest, we may be required to recognize taxable income from those assets in advance of our receipt of cash flow on or proceeds from disposition of such assets. for example, we may be required to accrue interest and discount income on mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. we may also acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. if the amendments to the outstanding debt are “significant modifications” under the applicable treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower, with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to modification. finally, we may be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.     41   as a result, to the extent such income is not recognized within a domestic trs, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt or (iv) make a taxable distribution of our shares as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with reit requirements. moreover, if our only feasible alternative were to make a taxable distribution of our shares to comply with the reit distribution requirements for any taxable year and the value of our shares was not sufficient at such time to make a distribution to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to the minimum amount required to comply with such reit distribution requirements, we would generally fail to qualify as a reit for such taxable year and would be precluded from being taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit.   even if we qualify as a reit, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.   even if we qualify for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to certain u.s. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from certain activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. in addition, in order to meet the reit qualification requirements, or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory, we may hold certain assets through, and derive a significant portion of our taxable income and gains in, trss. such subsidiaries are subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.   liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification.   to qualify as a reit, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory.   the failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to be treated as owned by us for u.s. federal income tax purposes could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit.   we have entered and may in the future enter into financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. economically, these agreements are financings which are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. we believe that we are treated for reit asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. it is possible, however, that the irs could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a reit.   complying with the reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively.   the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. under current law, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate, inflation and/or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit 75% and 95% gross income tests if the instrument hedges (i) risk of interest rate or currency fluctuations on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred to carry or acquire real estate assets or (ii) risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the reit 75% or 95% gross income tests, and such instrument is properly identified under applicable treasury regulations. income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the reit 75% and 95% gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise be subject to.     42   our ability to invest in distressed debt may be limited by our intention to maintain our qualification as a reit, and our investments in distressed residential mortgage loans may affect our ability to qualify as a reit.   we have acquired distressed debt and may acquire distressed debt in the future. in general, under the applicable treasury regulations, if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of (i) the date we agreed to acquire the loan or (ii) in the event of a significant modification, the date we modified the loan, then a portion of the interest income from such a loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test.   although the law is not entirely clear, a portion of the loan will also likely be a non-qualifying asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. the non-qualifying portion of such a loan would be subject to, among other requirements, the 10% value test. revenue procedure 2011-16 provides a safe harbor under which the irs has stated that it will not challenge a reit’s treatment of a loan as being, in part, a qualifying real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date the reit committed to acquire the loan or (ii) the fair market value of the loan on the date of the relevant quarterly reit asset testing date. this safe harbor will help us comply with the reit asset tests immediately following the acquisition of distressed debt. it will be less helpful if the value of the distressed debt increases over time. under the safe harbor, when the current value of a distressed debt exceeds the fair market value of the real property that secures the debt, determined as of the date we committed to acquire the debt, the excess will be treated as a non-qualifying asset. accordingly, an increasing portion of a distressed debt will be treated as a non-qualifying asset as the value of the distressed debt increases.   additionally, revenue procedure 2011-16 states that the irs will treat distressed debt secured by real property and other property as producing in part non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test. specifically, revenue procedure 2011-16 indicates that interest income on distressed debt will be treated as qualifying income based on the ratio of (i) fair market value of the real property securing the debt determined as of the date we committed to acquire the debt and (ii) the face amount of the debt (and not the purchase price or current value of the debt). the face amount of a distressed debt will typically exceed the fair market value of the real property securing the debt on the date we commit to acquire the debt. because distressed debt that is secured by real property and other property may produce a significant amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and a significant portion of such distressed debt may be treated as a non-qualifying asset for the reit asset tests once the debt increases in value.   as noted above, the applicable treasury regulations require the apportionment of interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test only if the mortgage loan in question is secured by both real property and other property.  we expect that all or most of the distressed residential mortgage loans that we acquire will be secured only by real property and no other property value will be taken into account in our underwriting process. accordingly, we do not anticipate regularly investing in residential mortgage loans to which the interest apportionment rules described above would apply, but we may acquire commercial mortgage loans to which the interest apportionment rules may apply. if the irs were to assert successfully that our distressed residential mortgage loans were secured by property other than real property, then a significant portion of our interest income from any distressed residential mortgage loans we own would be treated as nonqualifying income for the 75% gross income test, which could cause us to fail to satisfy that test.  if we did not satisfy the 75% gross income test, we could lose our reit qualification or be required to pay a penalty to the irs.   accordingly, we may be limited in our ability to invest in distressed debt and maintain our qualification as a reit, and our investments in distressed residential mortgage loans could affect our ability to qualify as a reit.   our ability to invest in and dispose of “to-be-announced” securities could be limited by our reit status, and we could lose our reit status as a result of these investments.   we purchase agency rmbs through “to-be-announced” forward contracts, or tbas. the law is unclear regarding whether tbas will be qualifying assets for the 75% asset test and whether income and gains from dispositions of tbas will be qualifying income for the 75% gross income test.   until such time as we seek and receive a favorable private letter ruling from the irs or we are advised by counsel that tbas should be treated as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, we will limit our net investment in tbas and any non-qualifying assets to no more than 25% of our assets at the end of any calendar quarter and will limit our investments in tbas with a single counterparty to no more than 5% of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter. further, until such time as we seek and receive a favorable private letter ruling from the irs or we are advised by counsel that income and gains from the disposition of tbas should be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, we will limit our gains from dispositions of tbas and any non-qualifying income to no more than 25% of our gross income for each calendar year. accordingly, our ability to purchase agency rmbs through tbas and to dispose of contracts for forward settling transactions, through dollar roll transactions or otherwise, could be limited.   moreover, even if we are advised by counsel that tbas should be treated as qualifying assets or that income and gains from dispositions of tbas should be treated as qualifying income, it is possible that the irs could successfully take the position that such assets are not qualifying assets and such income is not qualifying income. in that event, we could be subject to a penalty tax or we could fail to qualify as a reit if (i) the value of our tbas, together with our non-qualifying assets for the 75% asset test, exceeded 25% of our gross assets at the end of any calendar quarter or if the value of our investments in tbas with a single counterparty exceeded 5% of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter or (ii) our income and gains from the disposition of tbas, together with our non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test, exceeded 25% of our gross income for any taxable year.     43   the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans that would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes.   a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax with no offset for losses. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. we might be subject to this tax if we dispose of or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans, if we frequently buy and sell securities or open and close tba contracts that is treated as dealer activity with respect to such securities or contracts for u.s. federal income tax purposes. therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose to engage in certain sales of loans through a trs and not at the reit level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us.   the share ownership limits applicable to us that are imposed by the code for reits and our charter may restrict our business combination opportunities.   in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year after our first taxable year. our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take the actions that are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit. under our charter, no person may own, directly or indirectly, (i) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock, or (ii) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding capital stock. however, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, grant an exemption to the share ownership limits (prospectively or retrospectively), subject to certain conditions and the receipt by our board of certain representations and undertakings. in addition, our board of directors may change the share ownership limits as described under “businessrestrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares.” the share ownership limits in is based upon direct or indirect ownership by “persons,” which is defined to include entities and certain groups of stockholders. our share ownership limits might delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.   we may lose our reit status if the irs successfully challenges our characterization of our income from our foreign trs.   we have elected to treat ag mitt international, llc, which is domiciled in anguilla, as a trs, and we may acquire or form other foreign trss in the future. we will likely be required to include in our income, even without the receipt of actual distributions, earnings from our investment in any foreign trs.  income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations are technically neither actual dividends nor any of the other enumerated categories of qualifying income for the 95% gross income test. however, the irs has issued private letter rulings to other reits holding that income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations would be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. private letter rulings may be relied upon only by the taxpayers to whom they are issued and the irs may revoke a private letter ruling. based on those private letter rulings and advice of counsel, we intend to treat such income inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. nevertheless, no assurance can be provided that the irs would not successfully challenge our treatment of such income as qualifying income. in the event that such income was determined not to qualify for the 95% gross income test, we could be subject to a penalty tax with respect to such income to the extent it exceeds 5% of our gross income or we could fail to continue to qualify as a reit.   if our foreign trs is subject to u.s. federal income tax at the entity level, it would greatly reduce the amounts that entity would have available to distribute to us and pay its creditors.   there is a specific exemption from federal income tax for non-u.s. corporations that restrict their activities in the united states to trading stock and securities (or any activity closely related thereto) for their own account whether such trading (or such other activity) is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian or other agent. we intend that ag mitt international, llc and any other foreign trs we form or acquire in the future will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to u.s. federal income tax on their net income at the entity level. if the irs succeeded in challenging that tax treatment, it would greatly reduce the amount that those entities would have available to distribute to us and to pay to their creditors.     44   new legislation or administrative or judicial action, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit.   the present u.s. federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the u.s. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our common stock. the u.s. federal tax rules that affect reits are under review constantly by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs and the u.s. treasury department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to treasury regulations and interpretations. revisions in u.s. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could cause us to change our investments and commitments, which could also affect the tax considerations of an investment in our stock.   plans should consider employee retirement income security act, or erisa, risks of investing in our common stock.   investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for a pension, profit-sharing, employee benefit, or retirement plan, considering the plan’s particular circumstances, under the fiduciary standards of erisa, or other applicable similar laws including standards with respect to prudence, diversification and delegation of control and the prohibited transaction provisions of erisa, the code and any applicable similar laws.   erisa and section 4975 of the code prohibit certain transactions that involve (i) certain pension, profit-sharing, employee benefit, or retirement plans or individual retirement accounts and (ii) any person who is a “party in interest” or “disqualified person” with respect to such plan. consequently, the fiduciary of a plan contemplating an investment in our common stock should consider whether its company, any other person associated with the issuance of its common stock or any affiliate of the foregoing is or may become a “party in interest” or “disqualified person” with respect to the plan and, if so, whether an exemption from such prohibited transaction rules is applicable.   erisa may limit our ability to attract capital from benefit plan investors.   it is unlikely that we will qualify as an operating company for purposes of erisa. consequently, in order to avoid our assets being deemed to include so-called “plan assets” under erisa, we will initially limit equity ownership in us by benefit plan investors to less than 25% of the value of each class or series of capital stock issued by us and to prohibit transfers of our common stock to benefit plan investors. our charter prohibits benefit plan investors from holding any interest in any shares of our capital stock that are not publicly traded. these restrictions on investments in us by benefit plan investors (and certain similar investors) may adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to transfer their shares of our common stock and our ability to attract private equity capital in the future.     45   item 1b. unresolved
